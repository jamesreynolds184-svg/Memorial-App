1st Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron Memorial ; Freddie Gough Squadron,7,"1st Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron - The Freddie Gough Squadron. 
This black Scottish granite memorial is dedicated to the men of the 1st Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron, known as the Freddie Gough Squadron. The 1st Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron was a Reconnaissance Corps unit which formed part of the 1st Airborne Division and was sent to North Africa, seeing service in Italy, Arnhem and finally in Norway. It had various names before the authorities settled on the name by which it was finally known.  The first commanding officer was Major Freddie Gough and it quickly became known as the Freddie Gough Squadron. It should be noted that Major Gough came from a distinguished military family (see below). Charles Frederick Howard “Freddie” Gough was born in India in September 1901. He was awarded the MC for his actions with the Squadron during the Italian Campaign. The Squadron took part in the Battle of Arnhem; hence the location of this memorial. Freddie Gough was taken prisoner at the Bridge at Arnhem and remained a POW until he escaped in April 1945. 75 men from the Squadron escaped from the Arnhem Battle and at the end of the war were sent to Norway to help disarm the German occupying forces. During the autumn of 1945 the Squadron was demobilised. After the war Freddie Gough was Member of Parliament for Horsham and died at the age of 76 while on holiday on Italy in 1977.

216 Squadron RAF,13,"216 SQUADRON ROYAL AIR FORCE
In 1918 ‘A’ Squadron, Royal Naval Air Service was renumbered as No 216 (two-sixteen) Squadron Royal Air Force. It was designated a bomber-transport squadron for strategic bombing during the latter stages of WW1 and during the inter war years in the Middle East. On the outbreak of war with Italy in June 1940 the units’ aircraft undertook bombing sorties, then concentrated on transport flying, moving squadrons around the Middle East and Greece and keeping open the supply and reinforcement routes. In 1941 the Squadron agreed to provide a Bristol Bombay aircraft for the newly formed SAS for its first real parachute jump into the North African Desert. . 1955, the Squadron returned to the United Kingdom and received the Comet 2 aircraft and continued to operate these aircraft in the transport role, particularly for Royal and VIP flights. During the Falklands War the Squadron assumed the task off a refuelling Unit including the twice weekly schedule to the Falklands Islands At the end of July 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. No 216 Squadron with eight Tri star aircraft made a significant contribution including air-to-air refuelling and troop-carrying in support of both the RAF and US Navy, as it did later in Iraq and Afghanistan In 2020 No. 216 Squadron reformed to become an experimental unit that will test future drone swarm technology. Based at RAF Waddington. The memorial was dedicated in April 2022."

The No. 3 Fighter Squadron Memorial honours the courage and sacrifice of those who have given their lives to the defence of the UK through two World Wars, subsequent world conflicts, the ‘Cold War’ and general air operations. 
Squadron History 
In the Beginning 
Following the issue of a Special Army Order, dated 28th February 1911, the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers was formed on 1st April 1911, comprising No.1 (Airship) Company and No.2 (Aeroplane) Company. The creation of No.2 Company, stationed at Larkhill, marked the first formation of a British military unit composed of heavier-than-air flying machines. No.2 Company continued flying training including participation in the Army’s Autumn (1911) manoeuvres. 
The Royal Flying Corps The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was formed on 13 May 1912 by absorbing the Air Battalion’s No.1 and No.2 Companies, with No.2 Company being renamed No.3 Squadron (Military Wing) RFC. On the outbreak of World War 1 the Squadron deployed to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in August 1914 on reconnaissance, photography and artillery spotting duties. In October 1917 Sopwith Camels were received, and the Squadron became a fighter / scout unit. After the Armistice, the Squadron was reduced to cadre strength until re-established at Ambala (India) from January 1920 to September 1921. 
The Biplane Era 
After returning to UK the Squadron spent the 1920s on many short periods at various locations before arriving at Upavon in 1924 with Sopwith Snipes. During their ten-year stay, the Squadron flew Woodcocks, Gamecocks and Bulldogs. The Bulldog was deployed to Sudan during the Abyssinian crisis in 1935. Upon its return from Sudan, No. 3 Squadron introduced the Gladiator into the RAF which became the last biplane operated by the Squadron and as the Second World War started converted to the Hurricane at Biggin Hill. 
World War 2 
A brief period with the BEF in France was followed by relocation to Scotland on night-patrol duties. During 1943, the Squadron replaced the Hurricanes with Typhoons and switched to the anti-shipping and intruder roles. After re-equipping with Tempests in 1944, the Squadron destroyed 288 V1 flying bombs, and following D-Day in 1944 moved on to the Continent as part of the advance towards Germany. 
The Jet Era 
The Squadron remained in Germany, converting successively to the Vampire in 1948, the Sabre in 1953 and the Hunter in 1956. After disbanding (1957 –1959) a brief time with Javelin fighters was followed by an extended period of Canberra B(I)8 operations, before the Squadron converted to the Harrier early in 1972 at Wildenrath. In 1977 the unit moved to Gutersloh near the old East German border, before relocating to Laarbruch with the Harrier GR7. 
Following the closure of RAF Laarbruch, the Squadron returned to the UK in 1999, to RAF Cottesmore. Subsequently, No. 3 Squadron, along with its sister RAF Harrier and Royal Navy Sea Harrier units, combined to form Joint Force Harrier and undertook several deployments including on-board HMS Illustrious during operations in Sierra Leone. The Harrier aircraft of No 3 Squadron also saw action in Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina and both of the Iraq conflicts. 
Farewell to the Harrier 
On the 31 March 2006, the Squadron relinquished its Harrier role and moved to RAF Coningsby becoming the third RAF, and first front-line Squadron to be equipped with the Eurofighter Typhoon. The Squadron’s Typhoons continue to contribute to the RAF’s on-going commitments in Iraq & Syria plus participating in the Falkland Islands detachments and QRA (Quick Reaction Alert) to the present day. 
The date of dedication is May 12th 2023, a date which closely commemorates the 111th Anniversary of the Squadron’s inclusion in the Royal Flying Corps in 1912. 
Symbolism 
There are two faces to the memorial, the aspect facing the Armed Forces Memorial carries the Squadron’s battle honours, while the other side records the time line of its origin in 1911 and its status as recorded in official Air Ministry records. Both aspects carry the Squadron badge with the inscription ‘Tertius Primus Erit’ – The Third Will Be First. The central image is of a cockatrice mounted on a monolith, said to represent a fallen stone from Stonehenge. A cockatrice is a mythical beast that is hatched by a serpent from an egg laid by a rooster, and reputedly able to kill at a glance. The frontal aspect carries two smaller badges, one representing the first location of Larkhill on Salisbury Palin in 1912. Again, the stones symbolise the Squadron’s location of nearby Stonehenge. The second badge is carried on the Typhoon FGR4, which commenced operations in 2006."
36th Ulster Division,1,"36th Ulster Division. The memorial commemorates the actions of the 36th (Ulster) Division during the First World War. The 36th (Ulster) Division, formed in September 1914 under Kitchener’s ‘New Army’ recruitment initiative, played a vital role in the Great War. Commanded initially by Major General C H Powell C.B., the Division was made up from units of the Ulster Volunteer Force, which had been formed in 1913 to fight against Home Rule in Ireland. After initial training in Ireland, Seaford and Aldershot, the Division was deployed to France in September 1915 under the command of Major General Oliver Nugent C.B. D.S.O. The 36th (Ulster) Division took part in the long awaited ‘Big Push’– the Battle of the Somme - commencing on 1 July 1916. Remarkably, progressing as far as the German Third Line, they were the farthest advances made on the day. However, the Division subsequently got caught in German enfilade (flanking) fire from the side and from behind and with the possibility of being cut off with limited supplies they withdrew and were relieved the following day having suffered heavy causalities. The bravery and exploits of the Division are legendary - seeing action in many of the subsequent campaigns of the Western Front until the Armistice in November 1918. The Division ceased all military action at the end of June 1919 when the last soldiers were de-mobbed. It is estimated that The Great War cost 36th (Ulster) Division 32,186 men killed, wounded or missing. The memorial comprises a large, rustic, black granite stone on a base plinth with a black polished façade inscribed with gold lettering. The stone’s rugged profile, suggesting the toughness of the men who fought in the 36th (Ulster) Division, is emphasised by the lines of the polished face. The heraldic Red Hand of Ulster (depicted: sinister / left), which is the insignia badge of the 36th Division, is featured at the top of the memorial above the following inscription: This memorial is dedicated to the Officers and Men of the 36th (Ulster) Division who fought in the 1st World War and the Nursing and Medical corps who served beside them. At the centre of the memorial is a reproduction of the famous James Prinsep Beadle painting ‘The Attack of the Ulster Division’ depicting a scene on the fist day of the Battle of the Somme (1 July 1916), the original of which hangs in the City Hall, Belfast. The Division’s Western Front campaigns are listed either side of this.
Interestingly, soil from each of Ulster’s nine Counties has been placed within the memorial along with soil from the following battlefield sites: Somme, Messines, Passchendaele, Wytchaete and Polcapelle. In total, nine members of the 36th (Ulster) Division were awarded the Victoria Cross, four of which were awarded for actions during the Battle of the Somme.
Below the central painting is a verse from the poem Remember Them by D. Ross Campbell:
They heard the call, they answered yes,
They proudly wore the battle dress,
For us who live they gave their all
That our great flag would never fall.
The base of the memorial displays the inscription: At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them, whilst the reverse notes the memorial was funded by the 36th (Ulster) Division Memorial Association.
Footnote:
The famous Ulster Tower memorial (based on Helen's Tower in Clandboye near Belfast), which dominates the skyline around the village of Thiepval in Northern France, occupies the site of what was the German Front Line and is opposite Thiepval Wood where the 36th (Ulster) Division made its historic charge on the first day of the Battle of the Somme."

Arctic Convoys - Russian Convoys 
This memorial of black Aberdeen granite was dedicated on 14 August 2012 in honour of all who sailed on the Arctic Convoys during the Second World War. 
The memorial’s inscription is engraved in both English and Russian. Between June 1941 and May 1945, the United Kingdom supplied Russia with millions of tons of war-related goods. These convoys were protected by Royal Navy ships of many types, with only 22 losses. Men serving on these ships undertook this most hazardous journey through seas littered with floes and bergs with force nine and 11 winds whipping the seas into mountainous waves. It was always cold, both inside and out, with the permanent duty of ice breaking from the superstructure to prevent them from capsizing and sinking. The convoys suffered constant attack from the German Navy and Air Force from their safe ports in Norway. Winston Churchill called it “The worst journey in the world”. This is the only major memorial at the Arboretum paid for by one family: the Coyle Family. The adjacent tree is dedicated to Michael Joseph Coyle who served on Royal Navy ships escorting the merchant vessels to Russian ports. Millions of tons of war-related goods were supplied to Russia to help in their conflict against Germany. These supplies had to be carried by sea to Archangel or Murmansk. The convoys of merchant ships had to be guarded by the Royal Navy from attack by German naval and air forces. Weather conditions were usually very poor with frequent heavy seas and sub-zero temperatures. Winston Churchill called it ‘The worst journey in the world.’ The laser-engraved main image shows a British warship navigating in a stormy sea. Also shown are badges of the Arctic Convoy Club and the Russian Convoy Club. Script on the memorial is engraved in both English and Russian. The terms Russian Convoys or Murmansk Convoys could also be used for search purposes. 
The Arctic convoys of WW2 sailed from the United Kingdom, Iceland, and North America to northern ports in the Soviet Union – primarily Arkhangelsk (Archangel) and Murmansk. 
There were 78 convoys between August 1941 and May 1945 
About 1,400 merchant ships delivered essential supplies to the Soviet Union under the Anglo-Soviet agreement and US Lend-Lease program, escorted by ships of the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy and U.S. Navy 
85 merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships (two cruisers, six destroyers, eight other escort ships) were lost. 
In some books the Arctic Convoys are referred to as the Russian Arctic Convoys or the Murmansk Run"

Army Commandos Memorial,7,"Army Commandos Map Index
The British Commandos were first formed by the Army in June 1940, during the Second World War, as a well-armed but non-regimental raider force, employing unconventional and irregular tactics to assault, disrupt and reconnoitre the enemy in mainland Europe, Scandinavia, North Africa, The Levant (Eastern Mediterranean) and the Far East.Initially raids were made by comparatively small numbers, were of short duration and at night but later growing in complexity and size. The Commandos were formed and operated in secrecy and produced a demoralising effect on German coastal forces while achieving celebrity status among the British public, comparable with that attached to fighter pilots, and shrouded in myth. This memorial consists of a reproduction of part of the Association badge – the wreath in copper and the Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife in stainless steel. The impressive piece was created at Anwick Forge in Lincolnshire and dedicated in the presence of HRH Prince Philip, The Duke of Edinburgh, in July 2007. At the centre of the memorial is a stone with the names of eight commandos awarded the Victoria Cross. Behind the memorial is a roll of honour listing all 1,205 commandos who died in training or on operations during the Second World War. On examination of the Roll of Honour you will note that many were executed: this is because on capture they were executed under the terms of the infamous Hitler “Kommandobefehl” Commando Order."

Association of WRENS Centenary Stone,5,"Association of WRENS Centenary Stone. The installation of the AOW Centenary Stone took place on Wednesday 23rd September 2020 in the WRNS Garden.The memorial represents one hundred years since the Association was formed and it is very fitting that installation was able to go ahead in what should have been a year of celebration when so many planned events had to be cancelled.
The stone was constructed by Robyn Golden-Hann. It represents not only former wrens but also the Women of the Royal Naval Services as they are today. The WRNS were founded in l9l7 to support the men of the Royal Navy, but were disbanded in 1919. In 1939, at the outbreak of WW2, they were re-established and remained in service until 1993 when they were fully integrated into the Royal Navy. Women now carry out exactly the same duties as their male counterparts, both at sea and ashore. The garden is dedicated to all who served in the service and is designed to encourage birds, insects and butterflies. The pathways form the shape of an anchor. The wren, which was carved by the Essex Woodcarvers, forms part of a memorial for the 21 WRNS and a Naval Nursing Sister who lost their lives when their ship, SS Aguila, was torpedoed inl94l. One of the first WRNS to see active service was Wendy Clayin, who in 1990, served on board HMS Brilliant. The Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), known as the Wrens, was formed in 1917 to release Royal Navy men for sea service during the First World War. It was disbanded after the war. On 11th April 1939 Vera Laughton Matthews was appointed Director of the newly reformed Women’s Royal Naval Service WRNS: she had previously been a member during World War 1. It was originally envisaged that there would be about 3000 women in the WRNS, however at its peak the number was more than 65,000. Around 75,000 Wrens carried out highly confidential and responsible roles in Britain and overseas. The WRNS was fully integrated into the Royal Navy in 1993.
This charming garden at the far end of the Royal Naval Review is dedicated to the WRNS and has been designed to encourage birds, insects and butterflies. The paths are in the shape of an anchor. Buddleia shrubs provide a haven for butterflies in summer. The two rose beds are planted with “Wren” roses to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Association of Wrens 1917 – 2007. Notcutts Nurseries developed this rose for the 2007 Chelsea Flower Show and donated plants to the Wrens Garden at the NMA. In the rose beds and against the trees may be found dedications to individual Wrens. Located in the garden is the Aguila Memorial, a beautifully carved wren which commemorates the 21 WRNS and one Naval Nursing Sister who were lost when SS Aguila was torpedoed in 1941 (see M-152 Aguilla Memorial)."

Battle of the River Plate Memorial,5,"BATTLE OF THE RIVER PLATE (The first sea battle of WW2)
The Battle of the River Plate, which took place on the 13 December 1939, was the first major naval battle of the Second World War and the only episode of the War to take place in South America. The German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, commanded by Kapitän sur See Hans Langsdorff, had been terrorising Allied shipping in the South Atlantic. It was eventually tracked down and engaged by three ships from the Royal Navy’s South American division (the cruisers HMS Ajax, HMS Exeter, and HMS Achilles) commanded by Commodore Henry Harwood Harwood. All four ships sustained considerable damage and Graf Spee limped into an estuary in neutral Uruguay to undertake necessary repairs. Given just 72 hours to repair, the Germans knew escape was impossible and scuttled (sank) the ship in the River Plate. Two days later, in Buenos Aires where the crew were taken, Kapitän Langsdorff committed suicide. He was buried there with full military honours and the service was attended by British officers who were present in the city. This impressive black granite memorial was unveiled in the presence of the few remaining River Plate veterans on 12 April 2014 to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the River Plate. Significantly, it was the 300th memorial to be dedicated at the Arboretum. 
The Graf Spee was a German battleship; her mission, to destroy allied merchant ships in the Atlantic. 
In December 1940 she was engaged by HM Ships Exeter, Ajax and Achilles 
Exeter was badly damaged and withdrew; the other two ships, although damaged, remained on station. 
The Graf Spee put into Montevideo, Uruguay, which was a neutral country, so she could only stay for 24 hours for humanitarian reasons; however, she managed to stay for 72 hours. 
The Admiralty sent a signal to Ajax and Achilles informing them that a carrier and a battlecruiser were on their way as support; this was in fact one of the greatest deceptions of the war, they were not. 
Graf Spee's captain, convinced that stronger forces were waiting, left the majority of his crew behind and sailed out of the port where he scuttled his ship; he committed suicide two days later. 
Most of his crew stayed in Montevideo, others went to Buenos Aires, many of them married and raised families; the last surviving crew member, died in Buenos Aires June 2007 aged 89. 
The apron approaching the memorial shows the exact size of the shells that were exchanged. 
The front of the memorial shows the crests and silhouettes of the 3 RN ships, the reverse side is the ship's crest and silhouette of the Graf Spee. 
There are two quotes from Winston Churchill; ""This brilliant sea fight takes its place in our naval annals and in long cold dark winter it warms the cockles of the British hearts""; and other one says, ""This great battle will long be told in song and story"" 
Behind the memorial is a small pavier with the inscription, ""sealed herein are the names of those who served on HMS Ajax, HMS Achilles, HMS Exeter and Admiral Graf Spee who gave their lives whilst serving their country. Also, those who 75 years later supported the commissioning and dedication of this memorial on 12 April 2014. "
Bevin Boys Memorial,9,"Bevin Boys
Nearly 48,000 young men, all of them conscripts, joined regular miners in their work from 1943 - 1948. They were pressed into action because many miners had gone to war and at one stage coal reserves fell to less than three weeks' supply.  Ernest Bevin was the Minister of Labour at that time and decreed that every 10th man called up for war service would instead be sent down the coal mines.  The Bevin Boys were chosen out of a hat. Every month, for 20 months, Bevin's secretary drew numbers from his distinctive Homburg hat. If the number drawn matched the last digit of a man's National Service number, he was sent to the mines 
Comedian Eric Morecambe was a Bevin Boy (as was Brian Rix and Nat Lofthouse). 
The work was unfamiliar and dangerous; resulting in many injuries and lives lost. They were also often unfairly accused of being ‘Conscientious Objectors’, which they most certainly were not, although some Conscientious Objectors HAD been sent to work in the mines as an alternative to imprisonment. 
The plinths are made of Kilkenny limestone which will eventually turn black, like coal. 
During the Second World War 48,000 men were conscripted, via a lottery, to work in coal mines 
They were called “Bevin Boys” after Ernest Bevin, the Minister of Labour and National Service in the wartime coalition government 
The Bevin Boys joined regular miners in their dirty, dangerous but essential work to keep the coal supplies of Britain flowing 
The badge awarded to Bevin Boys can be seen on the face of the main memorial 
The smaller of the two blocks is carved with the tools and equipment used by the Bevin Boys 
There are also two mice carved on the memorial as Bevin Boys said that there were always mice in the mines. Can you spot them? "

The names of over 400 Gurkhas appear on the Armed Forces Memorial. The history of the Brigade from its inception in 1815 during the early wars between the Honourable East India Company and city-state of Gorkha, through the early Afghan wars, the two World Wars, the almost continuous post-war conflicts to modern day Afghanistan, is forged from the deep feeling of mutual respect and admiration developed between the British and their Gurkha adversaries. Following the Nepal Wars, and under the terms of the Sugauli Peace Treaty in 1816, Gurkhas were permitted to volunteer for service in the East India Company’s Army. From these volunteers were formed the first regiments of the Gurkha Brigade,and from this time stems Britain’s friendship with Nepal, a country which has proved a staunch ally ever since and has become our ‘oldest ally’ in Asia. Since 1997, the Brigade of Gurkhas has been operationally and battle proven in Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Macedonia and Iraq. With 11 years of continuous Gurkha deployments in Afghanistan, the human cost and sacrifice in Afghanistan has been high. Fifty four officers and soldiers of the Brigade have been wounded in action and 15 have died.
The memorial takes the form of a traditional chautara, a traditional resting place for travellers on hillside trails in Nepal. The plaque incorporates the badges of the units of the Brigade, past and present."

British Nuclear Test Veterans Memorial (BNTV),7,"British Nuclear Veterans Memorial
The BNTVA Formed in 1983, the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association (BNTVA) is a focus for all those who served at the test sites and combines comradeship with the objective of recognition of the ill effects suffered by some veterans, their families and children born with lung problems. The BNTVA believe that over 22,000 British servicemen from the Army, Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, Merchant Navy, and Royal Fleet Auxiliary participated in the British and American nuclear tests and clean-ups between 1952-1966, along with scientists from the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment and civilians. The BNTVA promote research into the effects of clastogenic radiation on the nuclear community, and educate the general public about the nuclear tests in creative ways.
The BNTVA has about 1,400 members of which one third are widows. Membership is limited to men who served in the nuclear test areas, their widows and their descendants.
The Nuclear Test Program
Between 1952 and 1958 21 atmospheric tests took place at the locations listed on the memorial. The yield from these tests varied between 1 and 150 kilotons.
3rd October 1952: the Hurricane Test at Monte Bello
15th & 23rd October 1953: 2 Totem Tests at Emu Field
16 May & 19th June 1956: 2 Mozaic Tests at Monte Bello
September-October 1956: 4 tests in the Buffalo series at Maralinga
May – June 1957: 3 tests in the Grapple series at Malden Island
September –October 1957: 3 tests in the Antler series at Maralinga.
November 1957 – September 1958: 6 tests in the Grapple Series at Christmas Island.
From the 1960s further tests were undertaken at underground facilities in Nevada in cooperation with the USA.
The Medal for British Nuclear Test Veterans
The BNTVA campaigned for many years for a medal to be awarded to recognise the service and sacrifice of the service personnel who had taken part in the tests.
At a ceremony at the BNTVA Memorial on 21st November 2022 the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that the British Nuclear Veterans would now be entitled to a medal to mark their service and said: “I am incredibly proud that we are able to mark the service and dedication of our nuclear test veterans with this new medal. Their commitment and service has preserved peace for the past 70 years, and it is only right their contribution to our safety, freedom and way of life is appropriately recognised with this honour.
This medal is an enduring symbol of our country’s gratitude to each and every person who played a part in this effort and their loved ones who supported them.”
HM Government website states that:
The Nuclear Test Medal will be a commemorative medal that can be worn by recipients.
The medal also recognises the contribution made by veterans and civilians from across Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Kiribati. All service personnel and civilians under UK command, including close partners from the Commonwealth and Pacific region, who participated in, or were present at, the British or American nuclear tests at the Montebello Islands, Christmas Island, Malden Island and Maralinga & Emu Field, South Australia between 1952 and 1967 will be eligible for the medal. This also includes scientists and local employees.
It is estimated that around 22,000 veterans will be eligible for the medal."

Burma Railway Memorial,8,"Burma Railway Memorial. This 30-metre stretch of track was bought back from Burma to form the memorial here at the National Memorial Arboretum. Construction started in June 1942 and after 18 months the 415km (257 miles) of railway was finished. The POW’s and Asian labourers, many of whom were Indians who had gone to Burma to work for the British, had to work long hours in extreme conditions and with little food. Over 330,000 men worked on the railway. Around 16,000 POW’s and 100,000 labourers lost their lives. It has been said that one person died for each sleeper that was laid. Burma railway actually took 16 months to build, 2 months faster than engineers estimated. This was because the Japanese pushed the workers to the absolute limit. The railway ran between Bangkok in Thailand to Rangoon in Burma, 600 bridges had to be constructed and bridge number 277 was the infamous bridge over the River Kwai. When this piece of track arrived here one of our Volunteers traced its origins only to find that it was actually manufactured in Middlesbrough! (There are embossed markings on the inside of the left-hand rail, just past the 9th sleeper)."
Burma Star Memorial,8,"The 15ft tall monolith is a copy of the one that stands at the Commonwealth War Grave Cemetery in Kohima, on the border of India with Burma, which saw some of the fiercest fighting of the Burma campaign, but is where the Japanese advance was finally halted.
It is intended to pay tribute to ALL organisations, armed forces and individuals who hold either the Burma Campaign Star or the Pacific Star with Burma Clasp. On the memorial is the famous Kohima Epitaph that has been used around the world on memorials and at remembrance services:
‘WHEN YOU GO HOME
TELL THEM OF US AND SAY
FOR YOUR TOMORROW
WE GAVE OUR TODAY’
The words are attributed to John Maxwell Edmonds (1875 -1958), an English Classicist, who had put them together among a collection of 12 epitaphs for World War One, in 1916. According to the Burma Star Association the words were used for the Kohima Memorial as a suggestion by Major John Etty-Leal, the GSO II of the 2nd Division, another classical scholar. The verse is thought to have been inspired by the Greek lyric poet Simonides of Ceos (556-468 BC) who wrote after the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC:
""Go tell the Spartans, thou that passesth by, That faithful to their precepts here we lie."""

The 78 Captain Class Frigates were all built in the USA and supplied to the United Kingdom as part of the lend-lease programme. They were all named after Royal Navy Captains who had served with distinction. 
They served as Convoy escorts and anti-submarine vessels, contributing to the sinking of over 30 U-boats. However 7 were sunk and a further 8 so severely damaged they were considered a constructive total loss. 
At the end of the war they were rapidly returned to the USA in order to avoid further costs. 
They can be divided into two groups: 
Evarts Type – displacement of 1140 long tons, 290 feet long, diesel-electric propulsion and a complement of 156

Changi Lych Gate,8,"Changi Lych Gate. This is the original Lych Gate from Changi Jail, Singapore, designed by Captain C.D. Pickersgill and built in 1942 by Royal Engineers from the 18th Division who were prisoners of war. The gate was first erected at the entrance to the camp cemetery to mark the graves of those who had died and to give their funerals some dignity. In 1952, the graves were moved to Kranji War Memorial Cemetery and the Lych Gate to the British Garrison Church, St George’s, in Singapore. When British troops withdrew completely from Singapore in 1971, the Lych Gate was dismantled and brought back to England where it was erected at the Queen’s Division Depot, Bassingbourn Barracks in Royston, Hertfordshire. In 2003, the refurbished Lych Gate was reconstructed at the Arboretum by the 39th Engineering Regiment and the re-dedication took place on 8 February 2004. In the structure of the Lych Gate was carved the national emblems of the British Isles. Inside the eaves, in Gothic lettering, is an inscription:
‘To the Glory of God
And in memory of those
Who laid down their lives
For their King and Country’.
The idea of a Lych Gate, familiar to prisoners from churchyards back in England, gave some feeling of dignity and respect for those who had died in appalling conditions. The Lych Gate is set in an area heavy with symbolism. It is the entrance now to the Far East Prisoners of War Grove. Most of the trees here are dedicated to individual FEPOWs, with some mentioning groups, such as the civilian and military women and children who perished and all the FEPOWs lost at sea while being transported."

'Moving Forward, Looking Back' 
This memorial was commissioned to coincide with the 225th anniversary of the raising of the Cheshire Yeomanry Regiment. With the constant uncertainties of future British Army structures and the unknown future threats of town planning, what better place to secure our memorial, for future generations of Cheshire Yeomen, than at the National Memorial Arboretum. We now have a permanent and fitting place to lay our wreaths and pay our respects to all our comrades. We have a focal point to be able to contemplate those that have gone before us. 
The Cheshire Yeomanry was raised as a light cavalry regiment in 1797 under the threat of a Napoleonic invasion. The regiment has built a proud history during that period. Our role remains today as Light Cavalry and throughout its early history up to and during World War 2 the regiment served with its constant companion, the horse. Since then, we have had another type of companion, who has been our protection, our weapon, our shelter and our means of transport, the mechanised vehicle. Our memorial represents the strength and power of a horse, but at the same time represents through its design, examples of many of those other vehicles. 
Designer and Sculptor - Joanne Risley (Sculptor) 
“I was very honoured to have been chosen to create the memorial sculpture for the Cheshire Yeomanry to celebrate 225 years since its inception. In response to the brief, I have designed a life-sized rearing war horse created using the mechanisms, structure and detail found on the Fox, Ferret and Jackal armoured vehicles. 
Objects of war mix with more familiar domestic objects such as a spade and the beloved ‘BV’ boiling vessel that provides the crew with hot water for tea and cooking. The plinth carries a turret wheel which frames the cast bronze regimental crest. I have tried to encapsulate the strength and dynamism of the animal with the armoured feel of the regiment’s vehicles. 
The arboretum already features a highly naturalistic life-size horse so I wanted to create a unique and modern monument that would strike a different note. The regiment kindly provided historic context, photographic material and access to Fox Barracks where I was able to study one of the Jackal vehicles up close. At the Cheshire Military Museum the Fox and Ferret armoured vehicles provided further inspiration. 
The body of the horse is tank-like and incorporates toeholds, wheel arches, rear lights and smoke canisters. The legs and thighs are formed from wheels and tyre treads with the helmet-like head supported by gun parts and a spine and ribs derived from the Jackal anti-roll system. 
The whole sculpture stands 3m tall. Created from weathering steel, which contains copper and smaller bronze elements, the overall appearance will take on a rusted and aged appearance whilst the material’s unique properties provide a protective surface that will endure indefinitely. 
As well as being of symbolic and emotional importance to the regiment, the horse embodies courage, freedom, power, endurance, personal drive, passion and heroism. The animal appears to be moving forward but looking back in order to represent soldiers of the regiment past and present. 
Joanne Risley studied Fine Art at Mid-Cheshire College, Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and then at The University of Ulster. 
She was elected a member of Manchester Academy of Fine Art in 2017. www.joannerisley.co.uk 
Materials Used - Rusted Corten steel, copper, and smaller bronze elements. 
Age of Memorial - The build was completed during 2021 and installed at the NMA in June 2022 and a dedication ceremony was held 12th June 2022. 
Symbolism - The Memorial has been created to allow visitors to remember those lost and to contemplate, surrounded by the memorials of all Yeomanry Regiments and positioned so that there is a full view from all angles of Yeomanry Avenue."

On top it has a bronze Chinthe, a mythical beast which guarded Burmese temples, from which derived the name Chindits. The Chindits were the largest of the allied Special Forces of WW2. They were formed and led by Major General Orde Wingate DSO. The Chindits operated deep behind enemy lines in North Burma in the War against Japan with the intention of preventing supplies being transported to the battlefront. For many months they lived in and fought the enemy in the jungles, totally relying on airdrops for their supplies. They had some successes but suffered greatly from the climate and constant shortage of supplies. Few of them were fit for further service after emerging from the jungle.▪ Listed on brass plaques affixed to the sides are those regiments and units from which the Chindits drew personnel."

Nine men were awarded the George Cross for Fire and Rescue duties that frequently involved burrowing through burning buildings in danger of further collapse; in fact the first individual to be awarded the George Cross was Thomas Hopper Alderson who was part of this group. 
Three men were awarded the George Cross for bomb disposal work, one of whom, Charles Howard was killed when the bomb on which he was working blew up. For security reasons the citation for these three men sometimes read “For conspicuous bravery in carrying out dangerous duties”. 
Two men, Frederick Davies and George Henderson, were Civil Defenders who have been awarded the George Cross for gallantry since World War II. George Henderson was a Gibraltar fireman who received a posthumous award for his gallantry: for this reason a piece of stone from the Rock of Gibraltar has been placed in the memorial.

On the night of 7 December 1942, ten Royal Marine Commandos climbed out of the submarine “HMS Tuna” and were launched into five two-man canoes. Their destination was Bordeaux Harbour and their mission was to destroy as many ships as possible using limpet mines which attach below the water line. This audacious raid was a success. However, some marines were lost in the icy cold waters of the Gironde estuary on the route in, and others were captured and executed by the Germans. Only two Marines survived the mission. This memorial is linked to the Phantom Memorial Garden located beside the Aspects Centre.

Fundraising for the museum started on the 15th February 2002, the 60th anniversary of the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese, which is when the majority of FEPOWs were captured. The majority of funding was raised by an organisation called COFEPOW (Children of Far East Prisoners of War). COFEPOW came about after a lady named Carol Cooper, from Norfolk, read an article in a newspaper in 1994, concerning the diary of a former prisoner-of-war of the Japanese. She realised that this was the diary of her father who went to fight in the Far East when she was only 2 years old but had died working on the Burma railway.
▪ After receiving a transcript of the diary, she went to Burma in an attempt to find his grave. Her journey was made into a documentary by the BBC. Many other children and relatives of such prisoners then contacted Carol and COFEPOW was formed in 1997. It took 3½ years to raise the funds, the same amount of time that the FEPOWs spent in the horrendous conditions of the prison camps. The building was officially opened on VJ Day 2005 the 60th anniversary of the end of the war in South East Asia. It is designed to take the shape of a prison hut. Inside there are exhibits and artefacts covering the experiences of the servicemen and civilians who were taken prisoner. In the far right-hand corner of the museum is a copy of the Java Windows.

Fleet Air Arm Memorial (FLY Navy Federation),5,"FLEET AIR ARM 
British naval flying started in 1909, with the construction of an airship for naval duties. In 1911 the Royal Navy graduated its first aeroplane pilots at the Royal Aero Club flying ground at RAF Eastchurch. 
In 1912, naval and army aviation were combined to become the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The Naval Wing of the RFC lasted until July 1914 when the Royal Navy reformed its air branch, under the Air Department of the Admiralty, naming it the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). 
By the outbreak of the First World War, in August 1914, the RNAS had more aircraft under its control than the remaining RFC. The roles of the RNAS were fleet reconnaissance, patrolling coasts for enemy ships and submarines and attacking enemy coastal territory. 
In April 1918 the RNAS, which at this time had 67,000 officers and men, 2,949 aircraft, 103 airships and 126 coastal stations, merged with the RFC to form the Royal Air Force. 
In 1924, the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force was formed, encompassing those RAF units that normally embarked on aircraft carriers and fighting ships. The year was significant for British naval aviation as only weeks before the founding of the Fleet Air Arm, the Royal Navy had commissioned HMS Hermes, the world's first ship to be designed and built as an aircraft carrier. 
In 2009 the Royal Navy celebrated the centenary of Naval Aviation, and the memorial honours the sacrifice made by 6,749 men and women who gave their lives in the service of naval aviation over those 100 years.

Free Spirit is a unique project that embodies the inclusiveness that is reflected in the non-judgmental partnership between horse and human. Gartmore Riding School in Hammerwich and many contributors raised funds to create a life-sized bronze statue acknowledging the horse’s unfaltering service to humanity, to be displayed at the National Memorial Arboretum, Staffordshire. There are few people left today that remember the essential role the horse played through history and how until a generation ago the horse was part of everyday life. The memorial expresses endurance, service and partnership and represents determination and trust, inspiration for which came from young people. The project brought together individuals from all ages and backgrounds sharing the importance of the horse to different generations, ethnicities and religions. The groundwork has been carefully designed to welcome all visitors, regardless of mobility or disability, allowing all members of society to enjoy the memorial together. The provision of spaces between the seats creates multiple points of access for wheelchair users; a lower plinth height and plaques incorporating Braille and Makaton allow the visually impaired to enjoy the memorial through a tactile experience. Free Spirit brought the essential contribution that the horse has made to humanity to new audiences and generations in a number of projects, including art, music and history, and worked across the local community and beyond. The opportunity to meet a pony has never been easily accessible to many of the young people visiting by the project, and Free Spirit recognises that the unique relationship between horse and human can increase confidence and self-esteem, and that this connection leaves a legacy that continues to bring joy to this and future generations. The horse is part of our story, and the people involved in its inception and creation were particularly proud to see so many young people engaging with the project. Inspired by the thoughts and feelings of these young people, Birmingham songwriter Dominic Malin wrote a signature song for Free Spirit. The song embraces the qualities associated with the horse and the music reflects the past, engages with the present and carries a message into the future. It is an honour to have horses in our lives and Free Spirit represents this for centuries and generations to come."

General Post Office Memorial Garden (GPO),9,"GENERAL POST OFFICE MEMORIAL GARDEN
In the first half of the 20th Century, the Post Office was the largest peacetime state employer in the United Kingdom, responsible for operating the postal, telephone and telegraph services. In wartime its staff had to rise to the immense challenge of meeting both civil and military communication requirements. Many transferred to the armed services where they often applied their experience and skills to communication work. 
In 1939 73,000 GPO workers were called into the services, just when mobilisation and evacuation caused millions of people to change address, so increasing the amount of mail posted and the problems of delivering it during the blackout. Post Offices played a key role by distributing millions of ration books, public information leaflets, and paying out allowances. 
GPO staff served in all arms of the fighting forces and 3,800 of them died. 
The path is laid out in the shape of the Royal Mail insignia. 
The older EIIR pillar boxes are from the period 1952 - 1991 and ‘Royal Mail’ appeared on them first in 1991. All have the crowns of the relevant Sovereign at the time. There are boxes for Edward VII and George VI. 
The green Victorian wall post box was blown out of its wall in Deptford, London during the blitz - note the damage - but the local people rebuilt the wall and replaced the box to keep the service running.

The Memorial honours those who have donated organs and tissue to save or improve the lives of others. It also recognises their families and patients who have received an organ transplant or whose lives have been transformed by tissue donation. Currently there are around 6,500 people waiting for a transplant in the UK and on average three people die every day because of the shortage of donor organs. The memorial was designed and created by sculptor Julia Hennessy-Priest. The Birmingham artist has spent years perfecting the work, which is inspired by the DFN logo, a colourful mosaic butterfly representing hope and new life, on top of a forget-me-not flower, as no organ or tissue donor will ever be forgotten."

The Regiment was established in 1942 and remained active until 1957, when it was absorbed into the modern Army Air Corps. The Regiment’s motto was “Nothing is impossible”, as the nature of their one way trips required the aircrews to subsequently join in combat operations on the ground. The Regiment’s highly trained aircrew was also used to great effect in covert activity. In the post war years, the Regiment remained active, undertaking liaison and reconnaissance roles in the Light Aircraft Flights operated by the Army. On 1 September 1957, the Regiment disbanded to create the foundation of what was to become the modern Army Air Corps. The memorial stone is sourced from Gelderland in the Netherlands to acknowledge the Regiment’s major role in the Battle of Arnhem."

The Guinea Pig Club, established in July 1941, was a social club and mutual support network for British and allied aircrew injured during the Second World War. 
Its membership was made up of patients of Sir Archibold McIndoe at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, Sussex, who had undergone pioneering reconstructive surgery, generally after receiving burns injuries in aircraft. 
By the end of the Second World War the club had 649 members. 
The memorial, which stands over 2 metres high, is carved from green Cumbrian slate and resembles the shape of a Spitfire wing. 
The design features a crashed Hurricane at the bottom with its vapour trail weaving down from the top. The logo of the Guinea Pig Club is also carved at the top of the memorial. On the left hand side of the design, the meandering vapour trail of the falling Hurricane outlines the strong facial profile of the pioneering plastic surgeon, Sir Archibald McIndoe. 
Along the memorial’s right edge is an inscription “Out of the flames came inspiration” provided by Guinea Pig Dr. Sandy Saunders. The memorial was unveiled by HRH The Duke of Edinburgh, president of the Guinea Pig Club, on 2 November 2016. Index

The Loss of HMS Glorious, HMS Acasta & HMS Ardent on 8th June 1940. 
Scharnhorst (Kapitain zur See Hoffman) and Gneisenau (Kapitan zur See Netzbandt), during the course of the Kriegsmarine’s Operation Juno, sank the aircraft carrier HMS Glorious (Captain Guy D’Oyly-Hughes DSO, 1159 crew and 59 RAF personnel were lost; only 39 survivors) and her two escorts HMS Acasta (Commander C E Glasfurd, there was only one survivor) and HMS Ardent-H41 (Lt Commander J E Barker, 152 crew killed and the 2 survivors became POW) in somewhat controversial circumstances. 
Why was HMS Glorious detached from the rest of the fleet sailing from Narvik and sailing with only two destroyers for escort? Why didn’t HMS Glorious have aircraft in the air watching for enemy warships? However, HMS Acasta torpedoed the Scharnhorst causing damage that put her out of action for the remainder of the year. 
Admiral Sir Charles Forbes recommended that both Commander Glasfurd and Lieutenant Commander Barker be awarded the Victoria Cross: they were awarded a posthumous Mention in Despatches.

HMS Ardent Memorial,5,"HMS ARDENT 
To the left of the Falklands Memorial is the anchor from HMS ARDENT, one of the ships lost in the Falklands conflict. 
Several years prior to the conflict she was anchored in Portland Harbour when a storm blew up and she was in danger of being driven ashore; to prevent this they severed one of her anchors and took her out to sea; the anchor was left on the sea bed. Following the loss of Ardent, Babcock Ltd. raised the anchor, renovated it and donated it to the South Atlantic Medal Association as a tribute and memorial to the ship and crew. 
This memorial is one of the original Anchors from the Type 21 frigate, HMS Ardent. The anchor was lost in a storm in Portland harbour in 1980. 
HMS Ardent was lost in action on 21 May 1982, defending the landings to retake the Falkland Islands. The HMS Ardent association was formed by the survivors. 
The anchor was recovered some years later and offered to the Association as a permanent memorial to all those shipmates who lost their lives in the

The HMS Charybdis and HMS Limbourne Memorial remembers the 502 sailors, marines and crew who lost their lives when both ships were torpedoed by German destroyers and sunk in the English Channel in October 1943 during Operation Tunnel. 
Operation Tunnel was mounted when the Royal Navy gained intelligence the Germans would be moving a convoy along the Brittany coast on the night of 22nd/23rd October 1943. The cruiser HMS Charybdis accompanied six destroyers should have been a formidable force for the engagement, but it is thought that the German shore-based radar gave the enemy advance warning of the movements of the British ships. Although the Charybdis picked up the approach of enemy ships on her radar, it was too late to anticipate a joint torpedo attack by a group of German destroyers. 
The Charybdis was hit by a torpedo first, and the destroyer HMS Limbourne soon afterwards, both ships sank, and the German ships withdrew, undetected.

HMS Dunedin Memorial,5,"HMS Dunedin
HMS Dunedin, a Danae-class light cruiser, was launched in 1918. During the 1920s and 1930s she served as part of the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, sailing around the Pacific. Returning to England in 1937, she served at Portsmouth as a Boys Sea Training Ship until August 1939 when she was allocated to the 12th Cruiser Squadron based on Kirkwall for service on the Northern Patrol. 
Dunedin spent time hunting for German battleships and during 1940 was operating in the Caribbean Sea intercepting German merchant ships. On 15 June 1941, the German tanker Lothringen was captured by HMS Dunedin, denying German U-Boats of vital oil supplies. Important, classified Engima material was also discovered aboard the tanker during its capture. 
On 24 November 1941, whilst steaming in the Central Atlantic Ocean, east of the St. Paul's Rocks, HMS Dunedin was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine U-124. Of her 486 crew, only four officers and 63 men survived. 
The memorial to HMS Dunedin was unveiled on 26th July 2003 by the last four known survivors."
HMS Formidable Memorial,5,"HMS Formidable 
HMS Formidable was an Illustrious-class aircraft carrier (28,661 tons full load) that saw extensive service during the Second World War. She was commissioned on 24 November 1940.
HMS Formidable took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 27 March 1941. On 26 May 1941, she received serious damage while transporting aircraft to Malta, being hit by two 1000-kilogram bombs that put her out of action for six months. After repairs in the United States, she re-equipped with Vought Corsair and Martlet fighters.
In 1942, she travelled across the Pacific and served briefly in the Indian Ocean, returning to the Mediterranean in October. HMS Formidable then provided air support for the North African campaign and Italian campaign (1943), including the Allied invasion of Sicily, before taking part in an Arctic convoy. On 17 November aircraft from HMS Formidable attacked U-Boat U-331 (the U-Boat that sank HMS Barham) and sank her.
On 17 July 1944, Swordfish aircraft from HMS Formidable were involved in an attack on the Tirpitz in Norway and took part in further attacks on Tirpitz in August.
During 1945 she saw service against Japanese forces with British Pacific Fleet and survived several kamikaze attacks while supporting the landings on Okinawa. On 4 May a Japanese kamikaze plane crashed into the flight deck, making a massive dent about 10 feet long, two feet wide and two feet deep in the armoured flight deck. A large steel splinter ruptured a steam line, and came to rest in a fuel tank, starting a major fire in the aircraft park. Eight crew members were killed and forty-seven were wounded: the 3"" armoured steel flight deck of HMS Formidable prevented further damage by Kamikaze attacks. By 5pm the fires were brought under control, the crater in the deck was repaired and Corsairs were again able to land on Formidable. A further Kamikaze hit HMS Formidable's flight deck on 9 May, but the level of damage was nowhere near as serious.
The accumulation of damage through the war took its toll on the ship. The bomb damage received in the Mediterranean had left her with damage that was beyond economical repair. She was placed in reserve in 1947 and was sold for scrap in 1953.
The blue plaque on the face of the stone memorial contains details of HMS Formidable’s Battle Honours and a reference to Lieutenant Robert Hampton Gray VC, DSC, RCNVR of 1841 Squadron - a Canadian naval officer, pilot, and posthumous recipient of the last Victoria Cross (VC) of the Second World War. Robert Hampton Gray is thought to be one of the last Canadians to die during the Second World War.
Located behind the main memorial to HMS Formidable is an oak tree which was planted by the HMS Formidable Association on 22 September 2001 and commemorates in tribute “all who served in and flew from this great ship”."

In December 1941, the destroyer HMS Kandahar and the cruiser HMS Neptune were sunk by mines in the Mediterranean with a loss of over 800 lives. 
The tragedy ranks among the heaviest crew losses experienced in any naval theatre of the Second World War and was the second most substantial loss of life suffered by the Royal Navy in the whole of the Mediterranean campaign. 
At 0300 on the 19th December the cruisers HMS Neptune (Captain Rory Chambers O’Connor), HMS Aurora (Captain William G Agnew CB) and HMS Penelope (Captain Angus Nichol DSO) and the destroyers Kandahar (Commander William Geoffrey Arthur Robson DSO, DSC), Lance (Lt-Commander R W F Northcott), Havok (Lt-Commander G R G Watkins DSC) and Lively (Lt-Commander W F E Hussey DSC) , the combined Forces B and K, steamed into a newly laid Italian minefield and HMS Neptune hit two mines and then while attempting to go astern hit a third. HMS Aurora and HMS Penelope also struck mines. HMS Kandahar attempted to pass a tow to the Neptune and struck a mine and had her stern blown off. Captain O’Conner warned all ships to stand clear. HMS Neptune sank later with the loss of all but one of her 765 crew; 150 were from New Zealand. 
On 20th December HMS Jaguar (Lt-Commander Lionel Rupert Tyrwhitt DSC) saved all but 91 of the crew of HMS Kandahar and then torpedoed the hulk. On 24th December, Able Seaman John Norman Walton, the only survivor from HMS Neptune was picked up by an Italian ship after spending 5 ½ days on a Carley raft.

HMS Sheffield,5,"HMS SHEFFIELD 
HMS Sheffield was a Type 42 guided missile destroyer and the second Royal Navy ship to be named after the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire. Commissioned on 16 February 1975 the Sheffield was part of the Task Force 317 sent to the Falkland Islands. 
On May 4 1982, the 4,100-ton destroyer was struck by a missile fired from an Argentine fighter bomber as it carried out a scouting mission off the Falklands - which Argentina had invaded and claimed as their own weeks earlier. 
The ship caught fire when a French-made Exocet missile hit HMS Sheffield and went deep into its control room. 
The blaze caused a poisonous smoke to be released and most of the crew abandoned ship. 
The “Shiny Sheff” 
The Shiny Sheff memorial honours the service of all those who served in the three ships of that name over 65 years and the 20 members of the Ship’s Company killed in action during the Falklands Conflict in 1982: 
The Cruiser (C24) 1937-67. World War 11 service 
The Destroyer (D80) 1970-82. Gulf and Falklands conflict 
The Frigate (F96) 1986-2002. Gulf. Awarded the Wilkinson Sword of Peace 
In 2020 with the 40th anniversary of the Falklands Conflict rapidly approaching the HMS SHEFFIELD Association agreed that a memorial should be placed at the National Memorial Arboretum to honour all those who served in the three ships of that name and that there should also be a place of remembrance for the 20 men lost when the second vessel of the name was damaged in action on the 4th of May 1982. In the spring of 2021, the artist Peter Naylor was commissioned to design a memorial which reflected all three ships and their close association with the city of Sheffield and its industries. The City of Sheffield Master Cutler was approached for assistance in making the memorial. The fabrication of the memorial was led by William Cook steel casting and supported by Tinsley Bridge, Outokumpu, and Charles Day Steels. The Association are extremely proud that their memorial was made of stainless steel by skilled craftsmen in the city of Sheffield. The memorial consists of a stainless-steel bow of a warship set in a stainless steel base, within in the deconstructed cruiser’s crest. The circular crest on the top of the memorial represents both destroyer and frigate. 
Materials Used 
Sheffield Stainless steel cast and sheet 
The memorial was constructed in January to April 2022 with ground-breaking in April 2022, it was unveiled by Mrs Penny Salt, widow of Captain Sam Salt, the Commanding Officer of the Destroyer HMS SHEFFIELD during the Falklands conflict. Mrs Salt consecrated the memorial on the 4th of May 2022 with a bottle of sea water collected in the South Atlantic by HMS Forth. 
Symbolism 
Positioned close to the South Atlantic Memorial and the corner of the Naval Field the memorial links the South Atlantic conflict with the large part played in that conflict by the Royal Navy and supporting Maritime services. 
The design of the memorial and its manufacture in stainless steel proudly links all three ships with the City of Sheffield and its world-famous steel industries. When they were constructed all three warships were presented with ship’s bells and fittings of stainless steel made in Sheffield. 
The memorial represents a warship at speed as it cuts through a dull grey sea during operations. The sea is set in the deconstructed pentagonal crest of the cruiser which links the second world war generation of sailors to the modern era. 
The warship crest on the top of the memorial takes the sheaf of arrows from the city of Sheffield Coat of Arms. The sheaf of arrows is a wordplay on the river Sheaf which runs through Sheffield and is also a reference to the iron and steel making heritage of the city. "
HMT Lancastria Memorial,4,"THE HMT LANCASTRIA 
HMT Lancastria a troopship, which was sunk off the coast of France, near St Nazaire, in June 1940. Lancastria was carrying both service personnel and civilians; it is unknown how many were on board at the time but some estimates are up 9,000. This was such a catastrophe that that Churchill ordered a “D Notice” - a total news blackout - for fear of the damage this may do to the country's morale. 
In WW2 many ocean-going pleasure liners were requisitioned by the British Government to support the war effort. 
HMT Lancastria's capacity was 1,300 passengers, it was deployed to St Nazaire, France, to assist in the evacuation of British Nationals and troops from France, two weeks after Dunkirk. 
On the 17 June 1940 it was agreed to load 3,000 onto the ship but that number increased during the boarding, estimated between 5,000 and 9,000. 
The Captain of Lancastria could have left port around 14:00 but the RN destroyer which was to escort it had been bombed by the Germans. 
So Lancastria's Captain decided to wait for an escort. Index 
Unfortunately, while waiting, a fresh air raid began at around 16:00 and Lancastria was hit by three or possibly four bombs. 
A number of survivors reported that one of the bombs had gone down the ships only funnel causing the ship to sink quickly - around 15-20 minutes. 
Opinions differ on actual loss of life but the general consensus is at least 3,000, up to around 7,000. 
A simple stone memorial is located in front of the ‘Lancastria Oak’ within the Merchant Navy Woodland, bearing a circular plaque inscribed with the Lancastria Association badge and emblem. 
The story of the Lancastria is little known but represents the biggest disaster in British maritime history. 
On 17 June 1940, the 16,000-ton Cunard liner Lancastria lay five miles off St Nazaire embarking troops, RAF personnel and civilian refugees, including women and children, who were being evacuated from France, which was then on the point of collapse. The exact number of people on board may never be known, but almost certainly exceeded 6,000; some estimates were as high as 9,000. 
The Lancastria was attacked and hit by bombs from German aircraft. The ship sank rapidly and, according to the estimate of the Commanding Officer, Captain Rudolf Sharpe, only around 2,500 of those on board were saved. 
Due to the scale of the tragedy and in the interests of public morale (this also being the day that the French government decided to seek an armistice with Nazi Germany), Winston Churchill forbade publication of the news at the time, hence the story of the Lancastria has never been generally known, although it is Britain’s worst maritime disaster. 
Since the Second World War, the Lancastria Association and Lancastria Association of Scotland have established memorials to the victims and carry out remembrance services every year. "

World War II was a total war; homeland production and sustainability became even more invaluable. Life on the home front during World War II was a significant part of the war effort for all participants and had a major impact on the outcome of the war. Governments became involved with new issues such as rationing, manpower allocation, home defence, evacuation in the face of air raids, and response to occupation by an enemy power."

Lisbon Maru,8,"LISBON MARU
The Lisbon Maru Memorial was erected in memory of the 828 victims who died in one of the worst war crimes perpetrated by the Japanese during World War Two. British prisoners of war captured at the fall of Hong Kong were being transported to Japan to work as slaves. After their ship was torpedoed the Japanese rescued their own troops but locked the POWs in the holds leaving them to drown, and shot at those who managed to break out. In 1942 the Japanese began sending POWs from their captured territories to Japan to work as slave labour in various industries so as to free up the workforce to be enlisted into the armed forces. The second shipment of POWs from Hong Kong was on the Lisbon Maru. On 27 September 1942 the Lisbon Maru, a Japanese armed freighter with Japanese troops on board, sailed from Hong Kong bound for Japan. It also carried 1,816 British prisoners of war held in atrocious conditions. Cramped, airless, and in unimaginable squalor they were incarcerated below deck in three cargo holds. The freighter bore no markings to indicate their presence. On 1 October an American submarine, the USS Grouper, on patrol off the Zhoushan archipelago in the East China Sea, engaged the Lisbon Maru holing it below the waterline with a torpedo. Although initially taken under tow, the line snapped and the ship drifted and foundered. The Japanese evacuated their troops, battened down the hatches over the holds and left a guard force to prevent the prisoners from escaping. For 24 hours the prisoners were held in sub-human conditions in darkness with no food, water, fresh air or sanitation; and dysentery was rife. There was a breakout before the ship sank the next day and many of the prisoners of war escaped from the two forward holds, some of whom were cut down by machine-gun fire. Most of those in the third hold, by then below the waterline, tragically drowned. Those who did escape were shot at in the water as they attempted to swim to the shore; many were killed or wounded but local Chinese fishermen courageously rescued 384 of the survivors. Later, the Japanese recaptured all but three.
Of the original 1,816 men on board 828 died in this terrible atrocity and a further 200 or more succumbed from their sufferings within a few months."

Originally the wood had 2,535 trees, each representing a British vessel lost at that time; the number of trees has been significantly reduced by the need to thin out the wood as the trees matured. Oak was the material originally used for building ships. Additionally, the wood was planted with bluebells to represent the sea. 
The ships cargoes included food, troops, armaments, ammunition and fuel carried to the United Kingdom and every theatre of war. The seafarers were civilians who faced the enemy and the sea with equal bravery and courage, to keep the supply lines open to Britain and its allies."

Mesothelioma UK,2,"Mesothelioma UK - Supporting our Armed Forces
In memory of members of the UK armed forces who have been diagnosed with the asbestos-related cancer, mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a cancer caused by asbestos that affects around 2,700 people in the UK each year. A number of those diagnosed are, or were, serving members of the Armed Forces. As part of a Government-funded project, national charity, Mesothelioma UK supported research into the effects of mesothelioma within our armed forces. Findings from the research informed the development of the charity’s UK-wide specialist service for armed forces personnel and veterans who have been affected by mesothelioma. As part of the project, the charity wanted to create a memorial to honour those who have lost their lives to the disease or are living with it. The memorial depicts building blocks of life, engraved with information about mesothelioma, asbestos and our Armed Forces.

Symbolism and meaning
The building blocks of life are represented by solid blocks of carved stone, constructed in a format not dissimilar to the game Jenga. The sculpture shows that even though the tower of blocks has been damaged in the middle, it is strongly supported above and below. This represents the aims of the charity. In addition to the tall tower of blocks. Each face will have carved across the surface of the stone, an inscription that describes both the aims of Mesothelioma UK and details of the disease. Some of the sections are slightly jumbled as the blocks have collapsed. The inscriptions are designed in such a way that the viewer is compelled to study the jumbled words and to try to rearrange the sentences in their heads, all the time learning a little about the charity and about mesothelioma. The Memorial has been created to allow families and friends of those affected to be able to visit the memorial and pay their respects or celebrate a key milestone."
Military Medallists' Memorial,6,"MILITARY MEDALLISTS’ MEMORIAL
The Military Medal was first established by King George V on 25 March 1916 to award Warrant Officers and other ranks for bravery in battle on land. It was awarded to members of the British Army and related services such as QAIMNS when the medal could be awarded to women after a ruling in 1916. The Military Medal was awarded for acts of bravery that were not deemed high enough for the DSM. In WW1 over 115,000 MMs were awarded with around 6000 bars. WW2 saw some 15,000 MMs along with 177 bars. The medal ceased to be awarded in 1993 and was replaced by the Military Cross. The final MMs were awarded for service in the last round of troubles in Northern Ireland between 1969-1993. (1969-2007) The memorial recognises all who were awarded the Military Medal since its inception in 1916."

Naval Service Memorial,5,"Naval Service Memorial 
The Naval Service Memorial is located at the heart of the Naval Section of the Arboretum and commemorates those who have served, serve today and will serve tomorrow, regardless of rank, trade or fighting arm. 
The striking memorial was created by Graeme Mitcheson, from a theme developed by Lt Cdr Nigel Huxtable. It is comprised of 13 coloured glass panels on a white granite terrace and includes a figure of Kilkenny limestone. 
The glass depicts the colours of the five oceans – steel grey with spume lines for the Atlantic, turquoise for the Indian, ultramarine for the Pacific and white for the Arctic and Southern oceans. 
Yellow is for the rising sun, red for the setting sun and the blood spilled at sea, and on land. 
On the memorial’s terrace stands a figure of a sailor, head bowed in respect to shipmates everywhere, cap held in the ‘at ease’ position. The figure faces west, where the sun sets. The terrace has a carved inscription of the Tennyson poem ‘Crossing the Bar’ – a phrase used when shipmates pass away. 
The glass panels cast a shadow suggesting the shape of a warship. Visible only in sunlight and for a few hours per day, it is best seen on 11 November. 
The curved shapes suggest waves and motion while the scale and colour hint at sails in a harbour. The idea for the ‘warship shadow’ came when the designer was in his garden, on a summer’s day, watching shadows cast by washing hanging on the line. 
The Naval Service Memorial was unveiled on 15 June 2014 by HRH Prince Michael of Kent. 
The coloured glass memorial was commissioned by the Royal Naval Association to mark the 60th anniversary of its being granted a Royal Charter. 
The 13 glass panels depict the different colours of the oceans of the world, while yellow is for the rising sun and red the setting sun. There are also splashes of red representing the blood spilled at sea, on land and in the air in defence of our nation. 
The panels cast a shadow, suggesting the shape of a warship, which is best seen around lunchtime when the sun is directly behind. 
The single figure faces the setting sun, head bowed, and cap held in the 'at ease' position, showing respect to his fallen shipmates. 
On the terrace edge is a carved inscription from the Tennyson poem 'Crossing the Bar', which is the phrase used by Navy personnel when a shipmate has passed away. "

The base of the memorial is inscribed with the words:
In memory of those who served on 49 Squadron 1916 – 1965
49 Squadron was originally formed during the First World War at Dover in April 1916. Its first 18 months were spent as an aircrew training unit equipped with BE2Cs, RE7s and Martinsydes. Between 1917 and 1918 the squadron was tasked with day bombing raids and high and low level bombing until the end of the war when it was subsequently disbanded in July 1919.
During the Second World War the reformed squadron operated as a front line bomber squadron and took part in most major operations by Bomber Command equipped with Lancaster Bombers. In peacetime the squadron carried out routine training and also saw action in Kenya.
In 1956, equipped with Valiant B1 aircraft (the first of the V Bombers), the squadron was tasked with carrying out a series of nuclear tests based on Christmas Island in the Pacific Ocean.
Reverting to the normal medium bomber role the squadron moved to Marham in 1961. On 5 June 1964 Her Royal Highness Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, presented 49 Squadron with its standard.
49 Squadron was disbanded at RAF Marham on 1 May 1965, when all Valiant aircraft were withdrawn from service.
Honours and awards gained by members of 49 Squadron during the Second World War include:
1 Victoria Cross (VC)
(Awarded to Flight Lieutenant (later Wing Commander) Roderick Alastair Brook Learoyd for his bravery during the successful low level attack on the Dortmund Ems canal, 12 August 1940. It was the first VC awarded in Bomber Command.

Following an air attack by Argentinian Aircraft on 24 May 1982 Sir Galahad was so badly damaged that she was deemed to be unrepairable and was towed away and sunk at the end of the conflict.
The central glade of the Merchant Navy Convoy Wood is an appropriate home to one of the anchors from Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Sir Percivale (a Round Table Class landing ship logistics, commissioned in 1968), donated by the Merchant Navy Welfare Board.
Outside the two World Wars, the largest loss of Merchant Navy lives was during the Falklands conflict. Sir Percivale landed troops in San Carlos Bay and was the first British vessel to enter Port Stanley following the Argentinian surrender. She later served in the Gulf War of 1991, was deployed in support of British operations in the Balkans and was present at the handover of Hong Kong to China.
She was decommissioned on 17 August 2004 and had been crewed throughout her life by officers and ratings of the Merchant Navy.

The Hong Kong Police Force was founded in 1844, when Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain by China following the First Opium War. The first Police O›cers were European and Indian ex-soldiers, together with some locally recruited Chinese. In 1845, Charles May, a former London Metropolitan Police Superintendent, took command of the 171-strong Force. Hong Kong grew in importance as a trading port and, following the Japanese Occupation during the Second World War, as a manufacturing, financial and tourist centre. The Force was honoured with the title ‘Royal’ following very serious disturbances arising from the Cultural Revolution which took place in China in 1967. By 1997, when sovereignty of Hong Kong returned to China, the population of Hong Kong was some 6.5 million people, and the Force consisted of 28,000 regular police o›cers, with 5,700 auxiliaries and 6,000 civilian staff."

Between the Yangtze Incident and Far East Air Force memorials, trees from the Indian sub-continent such as Kashmir rowan, cedar and Bhutan pine have been planted as a tribute to those who served in the Royal Indian Navy (1934 – 1947) and Indian Army. The memorial lies within a small area surrounded by a hedge. 
The British Indian Army (1858 – 1947) was a force recruited locally during the British Colonisation of India and commanded by British and Indian officers. Substantial numbers of Indian soldiers served in both World Wars. Note also the memorials to the Dogra, Baluch and Sikh soldiers. 
The Royal Indian Navy had its origins in the East India Company’s Marine, later the Bombay Marine. From 1830 to 1858 the Bombay Marine became the Indian Navy. After the end of Company rule in 1857 the name reverted to Bombay Marine until in 1877 it was renamed Her Majesties Indian Marine. In 1892 it became the Royal Indian Marine. With the introduction of the Indian Navy (Discipline) Act 1934, the Royal Indian Navy was formally inaugurated on 2nd October 1934; its ships carried the prefix HMIS. During WW2 the service greatly expanded, and the Women’s Royal Indian Naval Service was established. Two of its sloops HMIS Sutlej and HMIS Jumna played a role in the invasion of Sicily. In 1947 the Navy was split between India and Pakistan. From 1950 when India became a republic the ships have been prefixed INS."

Their motto is 'Per Mare, Per Terram"", which translates as ""By Sea, By Land"". They have been involved in every conflict since WW2. 
Ships’ Captains would always refer to the Royal Marines as ""My Marines""; this is because, unlike the Royal Navy, the Marines have never mutinied. 
This memorial is of Dartmoor granite to represent the one part of the country that most Royal Marines will associate with their training. 
The Corps was established in 1755 but their origins can be traced back to 28 October 1664 when they were initially created as the Duke of York and Albany’s Maritime Regiment of Foot. 
The Marines became the Royal Marines in 1802, an honour conferred by King George III, symbolised by the Lion and Crown on their badge. Many brave men and their families are remembered in this reflective place.

This memorial has been designed to reflect the work of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) crews and the relationship between crew members, a rescued person and all their families whose lives become interwoven during a rescue. It is intended not only as a celebration and recognition of the work of the RNLI but also to honour those crew members and people who have lost their lives saving others. The coastal scene creates a beautiful space in which to contemplate and reflect on the work of the RNLI. It embodies the journey of one member of a volunteer crew. As you enter you will see the statue of a lifeboat crew member. Take the path going to the left, and depending on the season, the colours of the plants are muted like the sea on a calm day. The stone monoliths represent more crew members heading out on a rescue mission. As you pass by the groynes and beach, you overlook the water. Throughout the year, the colours change to shades of red to embody danger and stormy waters. The stone cairn represents those rescued encircled by the crew and the last stone monolith on your journey symbolises the crews and survivors returning to safety and their families. In the north corner 29 trees reflect the pattern of the tides, which are so significant in the lives of lifeboat crews; there are 29 days (and 12 hours) between full moons."

In 1982, the Argentinians invaded the Falkland Islands; they have long believed the islands belonged to them and refer to them as The Malvinas. Britain's response was to send a Task Force to liberate them, whilst this was successful, it came at a price, and 255 service personnel lost their lives. 
As war was never declared this is referred to as the Falklands Conflict not war. 
The purpose of this memorial is threefold: 
1. To honour the Task Force; 
2. To remember those who gave their lives; 
3. To inform visitors about this important event in our history. 
The rocks are from the Falklands, and the Azaleas are a species created by a local garden centre called ""Azalea Antelope"" in memory of HMS Antelope, a Type 2l Frigate lost in the conflict. 
The plaque on the reverse of the central rock commemorates the 3 female Falkland Islanders who lost their lives during the conflict. 
The wall of Cotswold stone is modelled on the memorial that stands at San Carlos Cemetery. The central plaque on the wall shows the crest of Joint Service Operations, which is flanked by the 6 services that played a role in the conflict. 
The plaque at the base of the wall shows an outline map of the Atlantic Oceans and gives an indication of the vast distances the Task Force had to travel before engaging the Argentinians. 
Some stats: 
Human losses: 255 British; 3 islanders; 649 Argentinians.

Submariners Memorial,5,"The Submariner Memorial 
In 1921 the sum of £2130 was raised by public subscription to create a “Memorial tablet to the Officers and Men of the Submarine Service R.N.” on the Embankment. It was dedicated in June 1922 and remains a very important place in the hearts and minds of all submariners. Yet the Embankment is not the most peaceful nor easiest place to meet for collective or private acts of remembrance or for quiet reflection. Moreover, the Embankment Memorial recognises submarines lost in the two world wars but not the submariners lost since then. 
In the years since its opening the National Memorial Arboretum has grown into the centre of national remembrance and all armed and public services and many of their units and branches have placed memorials on this site. Indeed, the Submariners Association placed a small plaque here to submarines lost in the wars and another to our VC winners when the Arboretum opened. 
In recent years, however, there has been a growing call for a more fitting memorial for the nearly 6000 submariners who have given their lives in service and, for the first time, to have a memorial which recognises the sacrifice of their families. This was acknowledged in July 2019 when a group of retired submariners came together to form a charity - The Submariner Memorial Appeal. 
The aim was not only to raise funds, plan and install a new memorial, but in the process to bring the disparate elements of the submarine community together. The appeal was launched by the then Second Sea Lord in front of HMS ANSON in Devonshire Dock Hall at BAES Barrow-in-Furness on 28 February 2020 and a public competition to find ideas to inspire a professional designer announced. 
From over 600 entries, three age category winners and one overall winner were chosen and their designs given to three carefully selected professional sculptors. The sculptors were given wide latitude to be inspired by the winning entries but not to have to reproduce them. The resulting designs were all very different but all impressive, however, Paul Day’s entry immediately engaged the Board’s emotions and caught the spirit of the submarine service. 
Whilst Paul progressed the detailed design and casting of the memorial, fundraising ramped up. Around £500,000 would be needed. The appeal was very lucky to receive two particularly significant donations from the Gosling Foundation and from an anonymous donor. Submarine Industries were also very generous with 21 separate companies contributing. Livery companies, the Freemasons, the Royal Naval Royal Marine Charity, the RN Association and our submarine charities all supported the appeal and many individual contributions were made through crowd funding and a wealth of individual fundraising activities. These included running, rowing, cycling, painting, drawing, printing, coining (selling commemorative coins), writing, merchandising and more. The standout individual effort was Mr Graham Bishop who completed the London Marathon dressed as a model of a submarine.The money was raised in time for the turf to be cut by Diana Mayes, 100yr old widow of Lt Gordon Noll, CO of HMS UNTAMED and a young submariner from HMS VIGILANT on 6 September 2021. 
The memorial itself is 3500kg of bronze sculpted into a divided fin of a submarine with the lone figure of a submariner standing between the two halves looking to the surface. On one outer side of the fin is a frieze of families waiting for the return of their loved ones and on the other fin the Churchill quote: 
“Of all the branches of men in the forces there is none which shows more devotion and faces grimmer perils than the submariners.” 
The memorial is on a long low mound to give the idea that the rest of the boat is just below the water. An interpretation board is sited by its ‘port bow’. On this is a QR code which links to a new Online Book of Remembrance gifted to the Appeal by the Friends of the RN Submarine Museum. 
This is a very significant piece of work in it is own right, it features the most detailed and well researched list of those who gave their lives in service in submarines. It will allow people to add stories and photographs of those whom they have lost and the QR code will be shared with all the other submarine memorials (over 60) around the country. Funds have been set aside to add it to the Embankment Memorial as well. 
The Submarine Service was formed in 1901 when 6 officers and a number of ratings started submarine training. That same year the British Government placed an order for 5 American Holland class submarines to be built under licence by Vickers Sons and Maxim Ltd at Barrow-in-Furness. HMS Holland 1 launched in January 1902. 
Although some senior personnel within the Admiralty saw little point in submarines, Britain pursued an energetic submarine programme and by 1910 had 61 operational submarines. 
Submarines played a major role in both world Wars and a total of 14 VCs were awarded to submariners. 
From the start of the submarine programme, a total of 174 submarines have been lost - the majority during the two World Wars. The last submarine to sink was in 1971 when HMS Artemis sank alongside the jetty at HMS Dolphin during refuelling. "

You will see from the board that many of the bases were RAF and although we generally regard 1956 as the year of the ‘Suez Crisis’, the troubles actually began as early as 1951, when an Egyptian policy of non-cooperation with the British began.
This led to acts of sabotage and guerrilla attacks on British personnel and their families.

During WW2, the decision was taken to move a number of vulnerable people, mostly children, away from the dangers of German bombing raids into safer areas. This was necessary as the country was at total war and later statistics showed that more civilians than military personnel were actually killed during the conflict. Some 3.5 million people were evacuated, and the design of this memorial conveys some of the anxiety and confusion of the child evacuees through deliberate distortion of the figures - some hands are reversed and torsos twisted through 180 degrees. The split open luggage represents how families were torn apart by the evacuation process. The memorial was unveiled in the presence of the Duke of Gloucester by Michael Aspel, who was evacuated during WW2 from London to Somerset, aged 7. The memorial remembers over 3 million evacuees, mostly young children,who were evacuated from cities to the countryside to keep them safe from the bombing. But it wasn't only children evacuated - Over 100,000 teachers, around 500,000 mothers with children under 5 years, 13,000 pregnant women and 70,000 people with disabilities.

Townswomen's Guild,1,"Townswomens Guild
The Townswomen’s Guild Memorial is dedicated to those who have served in HM Forces or in civilian services and died as casualties of war, civil conflict or peacekeeping . It was unveiled by HRH The Princess Royal, Patron of the Townswomen’s Guild, on 5 October 2017. The memorial was funded by donations from Guild members, who raised over £15,000 through coffee mornings and imaginative initiatives. The Townswomen’s Guild was formed in 1929 but has its roots in the suffrage movement of the late 19th Century. During the Second World War many member of the Guild were conscripted, worked in hosptials, civil defence, factories or on the land. Others used their organisational skills to assist in the maintenance of civil society and staged shows and concerts to boost morale. Townswomen’s Guild is one of the largest women’s organisations in the UK with approximately 600 Guilds and 24,000 members. The Guild has seen significant growth in recent years from those attracted by the events, friendship, crafts and opportunities to campaign on social issues offered collectively and by individual Guilds around the country."
"Tree of Cherished Memories, The",2,"Tree of Cherished Memories 
The Tree of Cherished Memories is a magnificent four metre sculpture by artist Jill Berelowitz. Nestled amongst a landscaped wooded glade, this magical tree creates an alternative Remembrance space for all. Cast in bronze, the Tree of Cherished Memories is steeped in symbolism. Immortalising one of the Arboretum’s very own hawthorn ‘Crataegus’ trees, the design represents a peaceful connection between humanity and nature. Its interwoven trunk and visible roots emanate strength and determination, and the globe-like crown of the tree symbolises connection and togetherness. On the ground, a growing seedpod represents youth and new life. Glinting bronze leaves and figurative dancers are entwined within the branches and will continue to grow as personal dedications are added. Beautiful leaf and figurative elements of the sculpture can be individually commissioned as a dedication to a loved one, or to mark special occasions for celebration and Remembrance. If you wish to locate a dedication that has been made on the tree, please speak to a member of our team."

TS Exmouth Memorial,4,"Training Ship Exmouth 
This memorial plaque commemorates all the officers and boys who served on the Training Ship Exmouth (off Grays, Essex 1876-1942) and later as the London Nautical Training School (1942-1951). 
Having completed their training, the boys served in all branches of the Armed Forces, the Merchant Navy and the fishing fleets. 
In September 1939, at the outbreak of the Second World War, the boys were evacuated from the ship to Burnham on Crouch in Essex. In July 1940, they were moved on to Lydney in Gloucestershire, which became their main base for the duration of the War. A third move took them to them to temporary quarters at Bray Court, near Maidenhead, before finally locating to their last home at Wolverstone Hall in Suffolk. 
The ship was used by the London Fire Brigade as River Fire Station until 1942. It then moved to Scapa Flow where it was commissioned as HMS Exmouth, a depot ship used for the welfare, recreation and training of the crews for minesweepers and submarines. 
Following the Second World War HMS Exmouth returned to the River Thames and finished her days as HMS Worcester at Greenhithe. 
At the bottom of the memorial plaque is a dedication to those who gave their lives in Service which is accompanied by the quote “We Few, We Happy Few, We Band of Brothers” taken from William Shakespeare's play, Henry V. 
It was installed by the T.S. Exmouth Association in 2003."
TS Indefatigable Memorial,4,"Training Ship Indefatigable 
This memorial is in tribute to all boys from Indefatigable Training Ship and School (1864 – 1995) especially remembering those who lost their lives in service of their country. 
The first Indefatigable was an ex Royal Navy wooden frigate which was moored off Rock Ferry, on the Birkenhead side of the Mersey until 1914. The trainees, typically poor and orphaned boys whose fathers were seamen, were trained for a life at sea and actually lived on board the ship. The ship’s gun deck was converted to accommodate 200 boys in hammocks. 
The second Indefatigable (previously HMS Phaeton) entered service as a Training Ship on 15 January 1914 and continued to train boys in seafaring until 1941. During the Second World War the heavy bombing of Liverpool made it unsafe to stay in the River Mersey. The school found temporary shore-based premises near Ruthin in Wales before moving to a mansion at Plas Llanfair at Anglesey in Wales in December 1944. 
The School closed in July 1995, after which the premises was sold to the MOD who agreed to retain the name in the title of the new establishment; hence The Joint Service Mountain Training Centre Indefatigable."

There were 8 ships in the class - all except HMS Amazon took part in the Falkland’s conflict. Two ships were lost: HMS Ardent was hit by bombs dropped by Argentine aircraft on 21 May and consumed by fire; HMS Antelope was hit by bombs on 23 May, one of which was set off by the bomb disposal team attempting to defuse it on 24 May, causing the ship to catch fire and setting off her magazines, resulting in her breaking her back and sinking."
UK Police Memorial,2,"POLICE MEMORIAL
More than 4000 men and women have given their lives in the service of their communities while wearing the uniform. On entering there is descriptive text and a ‘Sillitoe’ tartan, evoking the Police uniform. The space is entered through a tall doorway supporting a brass screen. The doorway represents a ‘threshold’ - the threshold to a different space and ‘the dangerous places where police go’. Leaf-shaped apertures represent service, sacrifice and particularly lives lost: Absence. The brass will weather while the gilt edges remain bright, and as the sun shines the paved surface will be lit by this gilded absence. The leaf-shaped ‘stage’ with two further low screens, creates a more intimate space - like a Lady Chapel within a church. Lawn space for more than 1500 people enables ceremonies and services. Occasional bench seating provides intimate, reflective spaces, tucked onto and backed by the slopes and ring of trees. Raised edges to the sunny circular glade surrounded by a bold and simple ring of trees impart a sense of enclosure and protection, the glade itself edged and embraced by the wilder more natural wooded part of the Arboretum."

Ulster Ash Grove Memorial,3,"Ulster Ash Grove Memorial
The Ulster Grove memorial, made of Mourne granite, is in grateful memory of the men and women of the Royal Ulster Constabulary GC, the Armed Forces and other originations in service of the Crown who laid down their lives in the cause of peace in Northern Ireland 1969-2001. It was dedicated on 23 September 2003, the anniversary of the death of the first soldier in 1969. At the beginning of the UlsterAsh Grove is a stone circle reflecting the geography and geology of Northern Ireland. There is one block of stone from each county: Londonderry, Tyrone, Armagh, Antrim, Fermanagh, Down. They are laid out to form a symbolic map of Northern Ireland and enclose a simple granite pillar with a dedication to those involved and they form a tranquil place where people can rest and remember those who lost their lives. The lives of all soldiers (British and UDR) are commemorated by ash trees, one for each soldier killed in action. The ash was chosen because of the Irish song ‘Down by the Ash Grove’. The memorial trees are dedicated by Regiment and then by date of death. The Ulster Ash Grove was dedicated on the anniversary of the death of the first soldier in 1969. The Ulster Defence Regiment became operational on 1 April 1970 to support the Regular Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary in protecting the people of Northern Ireland against sabotage and armed attack. Both men and women originally served part-time but as responsibilities increased nearly half became full-time. 193 men and 4 women were killed on operations, in their homes or workplace. Another 63 were also killed by terrorist action. The UDR merged with the Royal Irish Rangers to form the Royal Irish Regiment on 1st July 1992. In October, the Queen awarded those who had served with the Ulster Defence Regiment and Home Service Battalions of the Irish Regiment with the unique collective award of The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. There is an avenue of trees and a pavement of dedicated granite paviours remembering each of those who died. The Royal Ulster Constabulary worked to protect life and property, prevent and detect crime, and keep communities safe from 1922 to 2001. While endeavouring to keep the fabric of society together against ruthless Irish terrorists 312 officers lost their lives and over 10,000 were seriously injured. Queen Elizabeth II awarded the RUC the George Cross for their gallantry and courage in trying to keep the peace in Northern Ireland. The memorial to the RUC is the RUC George Cross Way which has granite paviours identifying each of the 38 Sub-divisional policing areas in Northern Ireland with an Irish Juniper tree planted behind each one. Halfway along the RUC George Cross way is a black granite memorial stone from Mourne with the RUC and George Cross crests inscribed."

Vera Atkins - SOE Memorial,1,"Vera Atkins and the women of ""F"" section (French)
Special Operations Executive
Born in Romania in 1908, Vera Maria Atkins (née Rosenburg) was one of five children and the only daughter of a wealthy German-Jewish businessman. Adopting the surname ‘Atkins’ (an Anglicised version of her Jewish mother’s maiden name “Etkins”), she came to Britain in the late 1930s to scape the threatening political situation in Europe and the growing extremism and antisemitism
developing in Romania. Vera was recrutied by the Special Operations Executive and given special responsibility to the women agents who were being sent into occupied France to act as couriers, radio operators and to help train the resistance forces. After the war she went back into Europe to find out what had happened to her women agents who did not return and found that 12 of them had been captured and executed in German Concentration Camps. She is remembered as a resourceful, forthright woman whose special diplomacy and negotiation skills provided much needed intelligence during the Second World War. Before her death in 2000 (age 92), Atkins was appointed CBE in the 1997 Birthday Honours. She was previously awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1948 and made a Knight of the Legion of Honour by the French government in 1995. Located in the Allied Special Forces Memorial Grove is a memorial dedicated to Vera Atkins, Intelligence Officer of ""F"" section (French) - Special Operations Executive. The geometric shape of the seat is a Hexagram with the inner line being a Hexagon. The Hexagram has been a design used in all religions. This is built around a Pine Tree grown from a seed found in a cone at Natzweiler Concentration Camp in the Vosges mountains of Eastern France. The memorial was unveiled by Baroness Crawley, Baroness Verma, Colonel Nicholas Chambaz and Zenna Atkins on the 24 September 2011.

▪ We were importing about 70% of our food and the impact of U-Boats, a poor harvest and so many farm workers away fighting meant a real shortage of food. That is where these women came to the nation’s rescue. 
▪ Shown around the plinth are some of the trades they had to learn (Snedding is cleaning the side branches from a tree trunk and Snigging is moving a felled tree trunk by means of a chain wrapped round it, usually pulled by a horse). 
▪ The dead rat shows how important it was to control pests, known as ‘Hitler’s little helpers’, from eating the stored food. 
▪ The Timber Corps (known as ‘Lumber Jills’, as opposed to ‘Lumberjacks’) was formed in 1942, with the girls taking on the same work as the men and working to keep us supplied with timber.

They served all over the world in over 35 trades and over 1200 died in service.
The WRAC was disbanded in 1992
The raised beds form the letter ‘W’, while the trees and bushes either have ladies’ names or their foliage/flowers are the colours of the women’s uniforms.
Also in the garden is are two statues dedicated to all the women who served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS).
When the ATS was formed in 1938 there were 5 main trades: Cook, Clerk, Orderly, Store woman and Driver but as time passed, more and more trades were taken over, including highly-skilled and technical work and tasks which the organisation of the army depended upon, such as equipment and ammunition. Index
The Queen served in the ATS as 2nd Lieutenant Elizabeth Windsor as did Mary Churchill, the youngest daughter of Winston.

The ATS ACK- ACK memorial was relocated into this garden when the National Miners Memorial was erected at the NMA
During WW1 the code for the letter A in the phonetic alphabet was ‘Ack’, so the AA of Anti-Aircraft became ‘Ack-Ack’.
These girls had a strong link with the Royal Artillery, especially working alongside them in the anti-aircraft batteries. Officially the girls did everything apart from firing the guns (this was a political decision rather than a physical one), but we have had former ‘Ack-Ack’ ladies here who tell us they most certainly DID fire the guns, saying there is no way they would let their homes be bombed just because there wasn’t a man there to pull the lever."

The memorial represents one hundred years since the Association was formed and it is very fitting that installation was able to go ahead in what should have been a year of celebration when so many planned events had to be cancelled. The stone was constructed by Robyn Golden-Hann. It represents not only former wrens but also the Women of the Royal Naval Services as they are today. The WRNS were founded in l9l7 to support the men of the Royal Navy, but were disbanded in 1919. In 1939, at the outbreak of WW2, they were re-established and remained in service until 1993 when they were fully integrated into the Royal Navy. Women now carry out exactly the same duties as their male counterparts, both at sea and ashore. The garden is dedicated to all who served in the service and is designed to encourage birds, insects and butterflies. The pathways form the shape of an anchor. The wren, which was carved by the Essex Woodcarvers, forms part of a memorial for the 21 WRNS and a Naval Nursing Sister who lost their lives when their ship, SS Aguila, was torpedoed inl94l. One of the first WRNS to see active service was Wendy Clayin, who in 1990, served on board HMS Brilliant. The Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), known as the Wrens, was formed in 1917 to release Royal Navy men for sea service during the First World War. It was disbanded after the war. On 11th April 1939 Vera Laughton Matthews was appointed Director of the newly reformed Women’s Royal Naval Service WRNS: she had previously been a member during World War 1. It was originally envisaged that there would be about 3000 women in the WRNS, however at its peak the number was more than 65,000. Around 75,000 Wrens carried out highly confidential and responsible roles in Britain and overseas. The WRNS was fully integrated into the Royal Navy in 1993.

This charming garden at the far end of the Royal Naval Review is dedicated to the WRNS and has been designed to encourage birds, insects and butterflies. The paths are in the shape of an anchor.

The paths in this garden are laid out in the form of a letter ‘Y’. 
 “Y” comes from the initials for “Wireless Interception”…….”WI” sound like “Y” 
Inspiration for the memorial came from a group of ATS (Auxiliary Territorial Service) ladies who served in the War Office ‘Y’ Group at Beaumanor Hall, near Loughborough and other such stations. 
During WW2 men and women who were found to have the required skills and passed intensive Morse code training were recruited to serve at secret listening stations around the UK to monitor German radio transmissions which had been encoded using Enigma machines. 
Once intercepted the enemy's military messages, still in code, were sent to Bletchley Park - also known as Station X - to be decrypted by its talented, ingenious and often eccentric code-breakers. 
The Germans did not believe that radio messages sent over short distances in occupied Europe could be picked up in England. They could! In short, without the Y Service, Bletchley would not have had the coded Enigma messages to decipher, and the work of these combined teams of many thousands of secret and silent heroes is now widely acknowledged as having shortened WW2 by at least two years. 
Winston Churchill called those involved his ""geese that laid the golden eggs but never cackled"". 
In the right-hand corner is a bench in memory of the 3 Royal Navy men from the warship HMS Petard - Colin Grazier, Tony Fasson and Tommy Brown - who were instrumental in recovering code books from a sinking German submarine in 1942, which helped considerably in breaking the German Enigma code. 
Unfortunately, Colin Grazier (a native of Tamworth) and Tony Fasson drowned when the submarine sank. Both were awarded the George Cross. "

The circular planting of 46 Chinese euonymus plants commemorates each life lost during the Yangtze Incident in China in 1949. 
A plaque alongside the memorial tells the full story of the Yangtze Incident. Inside the circle is a black polished granite monument and trees planted as a tribute to HMS Amethyst, HMS Black Swan, HMS Consort and HMS London which were the four ships involved in the incident. The human cost in the four ships was 46 dead and 68 injured. 
The tree planted just outside the circle remembers the RAF Sunderland flying boat, named D-DOG ML772, from 88 Squadron. On its fourth attempt it landed successfully on the Yangtze River alongside HMS Amethyst to deliver medical supplies and a replacement doctor.

Between the Yangtze Incident and Far East Air Force memorials, trees from the Indian sub-continent such as Kashmir rowan, cedar and Bhutan pine have been planted as a tribute to those who served in the Royal Indian Navy (1934 – 1947) and Indian Army. The memorial lies within a small area surrounded by a hedge. 
The British Indian Army (1858 – 1947) was a force recruited locally during the British Colonisation of India and commanded by British and Indian officers. Substantial numbers of Indian soldiers served in both World Wars. Note also the memorials to the Dogra, Baluch and Sikh soldiers. 
The Royal Indian Navy had its origins in the East India Company’s Marine, later the Bombay Marine. From 1830 to 1858 the Bombay Marine became the Indian Navy. After the end of Company rule in 1857 the name reverted to Bombay Marine until in 1877 it was renamed Her Majesties Indian Marine. In 1892 it became the Royal Indian Marine. With the introduction of the Indian Navy (Discipline) Act 1934, the Royal Indian Navy was formally inaugurated on 2nd October 1934; its ships carried the prefix HMIS. During WW2 the service greatly expanded, and the Women’s Royal Indian Naval Service was established. Two of its sloops HMIS Sutlej and HMIS Jumna played a role in the invasion of Sicily. In 1947 the Navy was split between India and Pakistan. From 1950 when India became a republic the ships have been prefixed INS."
