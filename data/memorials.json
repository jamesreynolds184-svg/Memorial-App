    "description": "10th Royal Hussars Memorial\nThe Regiment was raised as Humphrey Gore’s Regiment of Dragoons at Hertford in 1715 as part of the response to the Jacobite rising. \nIn 1784, His Majesty King George III appointed his son, then Prince of Wales, as Colonel of the Regiment which has since borne the title of ‘Prince of Wales’s Own’ with the coronet and feathers, together with the Rising Sun and Red Dragon (an ancient badge of Wales) and the motto “Ich Dien” (“I serve”). \nThe Regiment campaigned in the Peninsula War and fought at Waterloo. The 10th were in the Crimea and were awarded two VCs in the South African War. \nIn 1806, the Prince of Wales obtained permission to clothe and equip the regiment as Hussars and it thus became the First Hussar Regiment in the British Army. The 10th Royal Hussars has taken part in most British Army campaigns around the world. On 25 October 1969, the 10th Royal Hussars amalgamated with the 11th Hussars to form the Royal Hussars. \nOne nickname is ‘The shiny 10th’, possibly a derivation from the earlier ‘Chainy 10th’ which came from various ‘chain mail’ type uniform insignia and decoration which needed to be kept highly polished.",

The Regiment is associated with notable personalities including Prince Albert (husband of Queen Victoria) from whom the Regiment got its famous cherry coloured trousers.

The 1st Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron was a Reconnaissance Corps unit which formed part of the 1st Airborne Division and was sent to North Africa, seeing service in Italy, Arnhem and finally in Norway. It had various names before the authorities settled on the name by which it was finally known.  The first commanding officer was Major Freddie Gough and it quickly became known as the Freddie Gough Squadron. It should be noted that Major Gough came from a distinguished military family (see below). Charles Frederick Howard “Freddie” Gough was born in India in September 1901. He was awarded the MC for his actions with the Squadron during the Italian Campaign. The Squadron took part in the Battle of Arnhem; hence the location of this memorial. Freddie Gough was taken prisoner at the Bridge at Arnhem and remained a POW until he escaped in April 1945. 75 men from the Squadron escaped from the Arnhem Battle and at the end of the war were sent to Norway to help disarm the German occupying forces. During the autumn of 1945 the Squadron was demobilised. After the war Freddie Gough was Member of Parliament for Horsham and died at the age of 76 while on holiday on Italy in 1977. \nThe Gough VCs \nThree members of the Gough family were awarded the Victoria Cross. \nGeneral Charles John Stanley Gough VC, GCB \nGeneral Hugh Henry Stanley Gough VC, GCB (brother of Charles & grandfather of Freddie) \nBrigadier General John Edmund Gough VC, KCB, CMG (son of Charles) ",

In 1941 the Squadron agreed to provide a Bristol Bombay aircraft for the newly formed SAS for its first real parachute jump into the North African Desert. . 1955, the Squadron returned to the United Kingdom and received the Comet 2 aircraft and continued to operate these aircraft in the transport role, particularly for Royal and VIP flights. During the Falklands War the Squadron assumed the task off a refuelling Unit including the twice weekly schedule to the Falklands Islands At the end of July 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait.

    "description": "3 (Fighter) Squadron RAF; 3 Squadron RAF \nThe No. 3 Fighter Squadron Memorial honours the courage and sacrifice of those who have given their lives to the defence of the UK through two World Wars, subsequent world conflicts, the ‘Cold War’ and general air operations. \nSquadron History \nIn the Beginning \nFollowing the issue of a Special Army Order, dated 28th February 1911, the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers was formed on 1st April 1911, comprising No.1 (Airship) Company and No.2 (Aeroplane) Company. The creation of No.2 Company, stationed at Larkhill, marked the first formation of a British military unit composed of heavier-than-air flying machines. No.2 Company continued flying training including participation in the Army’s Autumn (1911) manoeuvres. \nThe Royal Flying Corps The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was formed on 13 May 1912 by absorbing the Air Battalion’s No.1 and No.2 Companies, with No.2 Company being renamed No.3 Squadron (Military Wing) RFC. On the outbreak of World War 1 the Squadron deployed to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in August 1914 on reconnaissance, photography and artillery spotting duties. In October 1917 Sopwith Camels were received, and the Squadron became a fighter / scout unit. After the Armistice, the Squadron was reduced to cadre strength until re-established at Ambala (India) from January 1920 to September 1921. \nThe Biplane Era \nAfter returning to UK the Squadron spent the 1920s on many short periods at various locations before arriving at Upavon in 1924 with Sopwith Snipes. During their ten-year stay, the Squadron flew Woodcocks, Gamecocks and Bulldogs. The Bulldog was deployed to Sudan during the Abyssinian crisis in 1935. Upon its return from Sudan, No. 3 Squadron introduced the Gladiator into the RAF which became the last biplane operated by the Squadron and as the Second World War started converted to the Hurricane at Biggin Hill. \nWorld War 2 \nA brief period with the BEF in France was followed by relocation to Scotland on night-patrol duties. During 1943, the Squadron replaced the Hurricanes with Typhoons and switched to the anti-shipping and intruder roles. After re-equipping with Tempests in 1944, the Squadron destroyed 288 V1 flying bombs, and following D-Day in 1944 moved on to the Continent as part of the advance towards Germany. \nThe Jet Era \nThe Squadron remained in Germany, converting successively to the Vampire in 1948, the Sabre in 1953 and the Hunter in 1956. After disbanding (1957 –1959) a brief time with Javelin fighters was followed by an extended period of Canberra B(I)8 operations, before the Squadron converted to the Harrier early in 1972 at Wildenrath. In 1977 the unit moved to Gutersloh near the old East German border, before relocating to Laarbruch with the Harrier GR7. \nFollowing the closure of RAF Laarbruch, the Squadron returned to the UK in 1999, to RAF Cottesmore. Subsequently, No. 3 Squadron, along with its sister RAF Harrier and Royal Navy Sea Harrier units, combined to form Joint Force Harrier and undertook several deployments including on-board HMS Illustrious during operations in Sierra Leone. The Harrier aircraft of No 3 Squadron also saw action in Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina and both of the Iraq conflicts. \nFarewell to the Harrier \nOn the 31 March 2006, the Squadron relinquished its Harrier role and moved to RAF Coningsby becoming the third RAF, and first front-line Squadron to be equipped with the Eurofighter Typhoon. The Squadron’s Typhoons continue to contribute to the RAF’s on-going commitments in Iraq & Syria plus participating in the Falkland Islands detachments and QRA (Quick Reaction Alert) to the present day. \nThe date of dedication is May 12th 2023, a date which closely commemorates the 111th Anniversary of the Squadron’s inclusion in the Royal Flying Corps in 1912. \nSymbolism \nThere are two faces to the memorial, the aspect facing the Armed Forces Memorial carries the Squadron’s battle honours, while the other side records the time line of its origin in 1911 and its status as recorded in official Air Ministry records. Both aspects carry the Squadron badge with the inscription ‘Tertius Primus Erit’ – The Third Will Be First. The central image is of a cockatrice mounted on a monolith, said to represent a fallen stone from Stonehenge. A cockatrice is a mythical beast that is hatched by a serpent from an egg laid by a rooster, and reputedly able to kill at a glance. The frontal aspect carries two smaller badges, one representing the first location of Larkhill on Salisbury Palin in 1912. Again, the stones symbolise the Squadron’s location of nearby Stonehenge. The second badge is carried on the Typhoon FGR4, which commenced operations in 2006.",

    "description": "36th Ulster Division. The memorial commemorates the actions of the 36th (Ulster) Division during the First World War. The 36th (Ulster) Division, formed in September 1914 under Kitchener’s ‘New Army’ recruitment initiative, played a vital role in the Great War. Commanded initially by Major General C H Powell C.B., the Division was made up from units of the Ulster Volunteer Force, which had been formed in 1913 to fight against Home Rule in Ireland. After initial training in Ireland, Seaford and Aldershot, the Division was deployed to France in September 1915 under the command of Major General Oliver Nugent C.B. D.S.O. The 36th (Ulster) Division took part in the long awaited ‘Big Push’– the Battle of the Somme - commencing on 1 July 1916. Remarkably, progressing as far as the German Third Line, they were the farthest advances made on the day. However, the Division subsequently got caught in German enfilade (flanking) fire from the side and from behind and with the possibility of being cut off with limited supplies they withdrew and were relieved the following day having suffered heavy causalities. The bravery and exploits of the Division are legendary - seeing action in many of the subsequent campaigns of the Western Front until the Armistice in November 1918. The Division ceased all military action at the end of June 1919 when the last soldiers were de-mobbed. It is estimated that The Great War cost 36th (Ulster) Division 32,186 men killed, wounded or missing. The memorial comprises a large, rustic, black granite stone on a base plinth with a black polished façade inscribed with gold lettering. The stone’s rugged profile, suggesting the toughness of the men who fought in the 36th (Ulster) Division, is emphasised by the lines of the polished face. The heraldic Red Hand of Ulster (depicted: sinister / left), which is the insignia badge of the 36th Division, is featured at the top of the memorial above the following inscription: This memorial is dedicated to the Officers and Men of the 36th (Ulster) Division who fought in the 1st World War and the Nursing and Medical corps who served beside them. At the centre of the memorial is a reproduction of the famous James Prinsep Beadle painting ‘The Attack of the Ulster Division’ depicting a scene on the fist day of the Battle of the Somme (1 July 1916), the original of which hangs in the City Hall, Belfast. The Division’s Western Front campaigns are listed either side of this.\nInterestingly, soil from each of Ulster’s nine Counties has been placed within the memorial along with soil from the following battlefield sites: Somme, Messines, Passchendaele, Wytchaete and Polcapelle. In total, nine members of the 36th (Ulster) Division were awarded the Victoria Cross, four of which were awarded for actions during the Battle of the Somme.\nBelow the central painting is a verse from the poem Remember Them by D. Ross Campbell:\nThey heard the call, they answered yes,\nThey proudly wore the battle dress,\nFor us who live they gave their all\nThat our great flag would never fall.\nThe base of the memorial displays the inscription: At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them, whilst the reverse notes the memorial was funded by the 36th (Ulster) Division Memorial Association.\nFootnote:\nThe famous Ulster Tower memorial (based on Helen's Tower in Clandboye near Belfast), which dominates the skyline around the village of Thiepval in Northern France, occupies the site of what was the German Front Line and is opposite Thiepval Wood where the 36th (Ulster) Division made its historic charge on the first day of the Battle of the Somme.",

    "description": "Ancient Burial Ground \nAt the heart of the Arboretum is a Bronze Age burial mound that is between 3500 and 4500 years old. \nThe Bronze Age is the name given to the period of time between the Stone Age and the Iron Age. Bronze is a metal alloy, or mixture of tin and copper, and was used extensively to make a wide range of tools and weapons. \nThe monument was first identified from an aerial photograph taken in 1965, which revealed the visible cropmarks of a prehistoric multiple ring ditch. It was later Scheduled as a site of historic significance in 1969. Although there is little in the way of discernible remains above ground the site is now a set-aside wildflower meadow which attracts much important wildlife. \nDuring excavations in 1996, a prehistoric pottery vessel thought to be a late example of Beaker Ware, was discovered by archaeologists about 0.5m below the surface. Very few examples have been found in the Trent Valley and so this is an important find. The vessel is currently on display in the Landscapes of Life exhibition in the Remembrance Centre. \nIn the Bronze Age, many important people were buried under mounds like this one. Excavations show that it was probably part of a much bigger commemorative landscape that included other burial monuments. Between 1500 and 500 BC, this prehistoric landscape seems to have changed. No new monuments were built, and the meaning of the old ones probably faded as farming and flooding eroded their remains. Thousands of years later, archaeologists working during quarrying are revealing their stories. \nBronze Age burial mounds marked territory and reflected status. Their size and positioning in the landscape sent out a message. This mound is set above where the River Tame meets the Trent.",

    "description": "ARCTIC CONVOYS\nArctic Convoys - Russian Convoys \nThis memorial of black Aberdeen granite was dedicated on 14 August 2012 in honour of all who sailed on the Arctic Convoys during the Second World War. \nThe memorial’s inscription is engraved in both English and Russian. Between June 1941 and May 1945, the United Kingdom supplied Russia with millions of tons of war-related goods. These convoys were protected by Royal Navy ships of many types, with only 22 losses. Men serving on these ships undertook this most hazardous journey through seas littered with floes and bergs with force nine and 11 winds whipping the seas into mountainous waves. It was always cold, both inside and out, with the permanent duty of ice breaking from the superstructure to prevent them from capsizing and sinking. The convoys suffered constant attack from the German Navy and Air Force from their safe ports in Norway. Winston Churchill called it “The worst journey in the world”. This is the only major memorial at the Arboretum paid for by one family: the Coyle Family. The adjacent tree is dedicated to Michael Joseph Coyle who served on Royal Navy ships escorting the merchant vessels to Russian ports. Millions of tons of war-related goods were supplied to Russia to help in their conflict against Germany. These supplies had to be carried by sea to Archangel or Murmansk. The convoys of merchant ships had to be guarded by the Royal Navy from attack by German naval and air forces. Weather conditions were usually very poor with frequent heavy seas and sub-zero temperatures. Winston Churchill called it ‘The worst journey in the world.’ The laser-engraved main image shows a British warship navigating in a stormy sea. Also shown are badges of the Arctic Convoy Club and the Russian Convoy Club. Script on the memorial is engraved in both English and Russian. The terms Russian Convoys or Murmansk Convoys could also be used for search purposes. \nThe Arctic convoys of WW2 sailed from the United Kingdom, Iceland, and North America to northern ports in the Soviet Union – primarily Arkhangelsk (Archangel) and Murmansk. \nThere were 78 convoys between August 1941 and May 1945 \nAbout 1,400 merchant ships delivered essential supplies to the Soviet Union under the Anglo-Soviet agreement and US Lend-Lease program, escorted by ships of the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy and U.S. Navy \n85 merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships (two cruisers, six destroyers, eight other escort ships) were lost. \nIn some books the Arctic Convoys are referred to as the Russian Arctic Convoys or the Murmansk Run",

The Memorial is a stunning piece of architecture designed by Liam O’Connor, which draws its inspiration from the ancient landscapes of prehistoric Britain and the classical forms of ancient Rome. It consists of a six-metre-high earth mound, 100 metres wide at the base reducing to 50 metres wide at the top, which is based on early British barrows or tumuli. The spiral walkway that navigates the grassy slopes, planted with clipped holm oaks 'Quercus ilex', provides accessibility to people of all ages and levels of mobility. At the top of the mound stands a 43 metre diameter stone structure, comprising two curved walls and two straight walls which are constructed of 200,000 bricks faced with over 1,000 tonnes of Portland stone panels. In recognition of the importance of Armistice Day, a gap has been left in the two southern walls, which allows a shaft of sunlight to penetrate to the heart of the Memorial, onto the central bronze wreath. \nThe Memorial is particularly important for the many families and friends who have no grave to visit, or who remember those in graves in far-off places. The Memorial plays a valuable role in helping all who grieve for an Armed Forces service person to come to terms with their loss, by providing a focus for their grief as they pass through different stages of their lives. The names are arranged firstly by year and then in service order: Royal Navy, Army and then the Royal Air Force. Within service order the names are arranged chronologically, in the order of the event which caused the death. This ensures that those who died together are recorded and remembered together. The name and initials are shown without ranks but, where appropriate, honours are also included. In the summer of each year the names of those who have died in the previous year will be carved and their names dedicated at a special service. At the centre of the Memorial are two bronze sculptures, the embodiment of loss and sacrifice. Created by Ian Rank-Broadley, best known for his image of Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II which appeared on all UK and Commonwealth coinage produced between 1998 - 2015, the sculptures bear silent witness to the cost of armed conflict. This significant work is becoming an icon identifiable to all and especially to those who live with the consequences of the Nation’s call to duty.",

The Commandos were formed and operated in secrecy and produced a demoralising effect on German coastal forces while achieving celebrity status among the British public, comparable with that attached to fighter pilots, and shrouded in myth. This memorial consists of a reproduction of part of the Association badge – the wreath in copper and the Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife in stainless steel. The impressive piece was created at Anwick Forge in Lincolnshire and dedicated in the presence of HRH Prince Philip, The Duke of Edinburgh, in July 2007. At the centre of the memorial is a stone with the names of eight commandos awarded the Victoria Cross. Behind the memorial is a roll of honour listing all 1,205 commandos who died in training or on operations during the Second World War.

The installation of the AOW Centenary Stone took place on Wednesday 23rd September 2020 in the WRNS Garden.The memorial represents one hundred years since the Association was formed and it is very fitting that installation was able to go ahead in what should have been a year of celebration when so many planned events had to be cancelled.\nThe stone was constructed by Robyn Golden-Hann. It represents not only former wrens but also the Women of the Royal Naval Services as they are today. The WRNS were founded in l9l7 to support the men of the Royal Navy, but were disbanded in 1919. In 1939, at the outbreak of WW2, they were re-established and remained in service until 1993 when they were fully integrated into the Royal Navy. Women now carry out exactly the same duties as their male counterparts, both at sea and ashore. The garden is dedicated to all who served in the service and is designed to encourage birds, insects and butterflies. The pathways form the shape of an anchor. The wren, which was carved by the Essex Woodcarvers, forms part of a memorial for the 21 WRNS and a Naval Nursing Sister who lost their lives when their ship, SS Aguila, was torpedoed inl94l. One of the first WRNS to see active service was Wendy Clayin, who in 1990, served on board HMS Brilliant. The Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), known as the Wrens, was formed in 1917 to release Royal Navy men for sea service during the First World War. It was disbanded after the war. On 11th April 1939 Vera Laughton Matthews was appointed Director of the newly reformed Women’s Royal Naval Service WRNS: she had previously been a member during World War 1. It was originally envisaged that there would be about 3000 women in the WRNS, however at its peak the number was more than 65,000. Around 75,000 Wrens carried out highly confidential and responsible roles in Britain and overseas. The WRNS was fully integrated into the Royal Navy in 1993.\nThis charming garden at the far end of the Royal Naval Review is dedicated to the WRNS and has been designed to encourage birds, insects and butterflies. The paths are in the shape of an anchor. Buddleia shrubs provide a haven for butterflies in summer. The two rose beds are planted with “Wren” roses to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Association of Wrens 1917 – 2007. Notcutts Nurseries developed this rose for the 2007 Chelsea Flower Show and donated plants to the Wrens Garden at the NMA. In the rose beds and against the trees may be found dedications to individual Wrens. Located in the garden is the Aguila Memorial, a beautifully carved wren which commemorates the 21 WRNS and one Naval Nursing Sister who were lost when SS Aguila was torpedoed in 1941 (see M-152 Aguilla Memorial).",

It also lists members of Coalition Forces who were killed whilst under United Kingdom command during the six years of conflict. The original memorial was built in Basra in 2006 and stood outside the front of the Headquarters of the Multi-National Division (South East). It was originally built by members of the Royal Engineers on their own initiative and in their own time, often in darkness and after a hard day’s work. The Wall was dismantled, and reconstructed at the Arboretum by British soldiers from 37th Armoured Engineer Squadron in a personal gesture to commemorate their fallen comrades. The original bricks would not have survived our climate, so have been incorporated into the foundations and replaced by red granite. The brass plaques on this memorial are the originals placed on the wall when it was in situ in Basra, Iraq. The plaques are cleaned twice a year; before the anniversary of the end of combat operations in Iraq and before Armistice, but in between they are allowed to weather naturally. This will allow the detail on these original plaques to last for as long as possible for the benefit of future generations. \nOn the back of the memorial is a representation of the Iraq Medal; the campaign medal issued to O›cers and Other Ranks of the British Armed Forces as well as others, who served on, or in support of, Operation TELIC. It depicts an Assyrian protective deity, known as a Lamassu and often shown with a bull or lion’s body, eagle’s wings, and human head. The bull demonstrates strength. The eagle, being the most powerful bird in the sky, symbolises the king’s power as he looks over those he rules. The crowned human head represents intelligence. On top of the head is a crown, which features horns as a sign of divinity. It is symbolic of the region in which British service personnel fought.",

    "description": "BATTLE OF THE RIVER PLATE (The first sea battle of WW2)\nThe Battle of the River Plate, which took place on the 13 December 1939, was the first major naval battle of the Second World War and the only episode of the War to take place in South America. The German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, commanded by Kapitän sur See Hans Langsdorff, had been terrorising Allied shipping in the South Atlantic. It was eventually tracked down and engaged by three ships from the Royal Navy’s South American division (the cruisers HMS Ajax, HMS Exeter, and HMS Achilles) commanded by Commodore Henry Harwood Harwood. All four ships sustained considerable damage and Graf Spee limped into an estuary in neutral Uruguay to undertake necessary repairs. Given just 72 hours to repair, the Germans knew escape was impossible and scuttled (sank) the ship in the River Plate. Two days later, in Buenos Aires where the crew were taken, Kapitän Langsdorff committed suicide. He was buried there with full military honours and the service was attended by British officers who were present in the city. This impressive black granite memorial was unveiled in the presence of the few remaining River Plate veterans on 12 April 2014 to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the River Plate. Significantly, it was the 300th memorial to be dedicated at the Arboretum. \nThe Graf Spee was a German battleship; her mission, to destroy allied merchant ships in the Atlantic. \nIn December 1940 she was engaged by HM Ships Exeter, Ajax and Achilles \nExeter was badly damaged and withdrew; the other two ships, although damaged, remained on station. \nThe Graf Spee put into Montevideo, Uruguay, which was a neutral country, so she could only stay for 24 hours for humanitarian reasons; however, she managed to stay for 72 hours. \nThe Admiralty sent a signal to Ajax and Achilles informing them that a carrier and a battlecruiser were on their way as support; this was in fact one of the greatest deceptions of the war, they were not. \nGraf Spee's captain, convinced that stronger forces were waiting, left the majority of his crew behind and sailed out of the port where he scuttled his ship; he committed suicide two days later. \nMost of his crew stayed in Montevideo, others went to Buenos Aires, many of them married and raised families; the last surviving crew member, died in Buenos Aires June 2007 aged 89. \nThe apron approaching the memorial shows the exact size of the shells that were exchanged. \nThe front of the memorial shows the crests and silhouettes of the 3 RN ships, the reverse side is the ship's crest and silhouette of the Graf Spee. \nThere are two quotes from Winston Churchill; \"This brilliant sea fight takes its place in our naval annals and in long cold dark winter it warms the cockles of the British hearts\"; and other one says, \"This great battle will long be told in song and story\" \nBehind the memorial is a small pavier with the inscription, \"sealed herein are the names of those who served on HMS Ajax, HMS Achilles, HMS Exeter and Admiral Graf Spee who gave their lives whilst serving their country. Also, those who 75 years later supported the commissioning and dedication of this memorial on 12 April 2014. ",

They were pressed into action because many miners had gone to war and at one stage coal reserves fell to less than three weeks' supply.  Ernest Bevin was the Minister of Labour at that time and decreed that every 10th man called up for war service would instead be sent down the coal mines.  The Bevin Boys were chosen out of a hat. Every month, for 20 months, Bevin's secretary drew numbers from his distinctive Homburg hat. If the number drawn matched the last digit of a man's National Service number, he was sent to the mines \nComedian Eric Morecambe was a Bevin Boy (as was Brian Rix and Nat Lofthouse). \nThe work was unfamiliar and dangerous; resulting in many injuries and lives lost. They were also often unfairly accused of being ‘Conscientious Objectors’, which they most certainly were not, although some Conscientious Objectors HAD been sent to work in the mines as an alternative to imprisonment. \nThe plinths are made of Kilkenny limestone which will eventually turn black, like coal. \nDuring the Second World War 48,000 men were conscripted, via a lottery, to work in coal mines \nThey were called “Bevin Boys” after Ernest Bevin, the Minister of Labour and National Service in the wartime coalition government \nThe Bevin Boys joined regular miners in their dirty, dangerous but essential work to keep the coal supplies of Britain flowing \nThe badge awarded to Bevin Boys can be seen on the face of the main memorial \nThe smaller of the two blocks is carved with the tools and equipment used by the Bevin Boys \nThere are also two mice carved on the memorial as Bevin Boys said that there were always mice in the mines.

The history of the Brigade from its inception in 1815 during the early wars between the Honourable East India Company and city-state of Gorkha, through the early Afghan wars, the two World Wars, the almost continuous post-war conflicts to modern day Afghanistan, is forged from the deep feeling of mutual respect and admiration developed between the British and their Gurkha adversaries. Following the Nepal Wars, and under the terms of the Sugauli Peace Treaty in 1816, Gurkhas were permitted to volunteer for service in the East India Company’s Army. From these volunteers were formed the first regiments of the Gurkha Brigade,and from this time stems Britain’s friendship with Nepal, a country which has proved a staunch ally ever since and has become our ‘oldest ally’ in Asia. Since 1997, the Brigade of Gurkhas has been operationally and battle proven in Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Macedonia and Iraq. With 11 years of continuous Gurkha deployments in Afghanistan, the human cost and sacrifice in Afghanistan has been high. Fifty four officers and soldiers of the Brigade have been wounded in action and 15 have died.\nThe memorial takes the form of a traditional chautara, a traditional resting place for travellers on hillside trails in Nepal.

Every day for the next 323 days, around 2.3 million tons of cargo were flown in by the American and British and Commonwealth Air Forces, together with allied Air Forces. \n▪ Around 300 aircraft took part in the airlift, around 300,000 flights in all. \n▪ Eventually the Russians conceded the blockade was a failure and withdrew the blockade. \n▪ The theme of the memorial is three air corridors which created what was known as the \"Air Bridge\".

According to the Burma Star Association the words were used for the Kohima Memorial as a suggestion by Major John Etty-Leal, the GSO II of the 2nd Division, another classical scholar.

    "description": "Changi Lych Gate. This is the original Lych Gate from Changi Jail, Singapore, designed by Captain C.D. Pickersgill and built in 1942 by Royal Engineers from the 18th Division who were prisoners of war. The gate was first erected at the entrance to the camp cemetery to mark the graves of those who had died and to give their funerals some dignity. In 1952, the graves were moved to Kranji War Memorial Cemetery and the Lych Gate to the British Garrison Church, St George’s, in Singapore. When British troops withdrew completely from Singapore in 1971, the Lych Gate was dismantled and brought back to England where it was erected at the Queen’s Division Depot, Bassingbourn Barracks in Royston, Hertfordshire. In 2003, the refurbished Lych Gate was reconstructed at the Arboretum by the 39th Engineering Regiment and the re-dedication took place on 8 February 2004. In the structure of the Lych Gate was carved the national emblems of the British Isles. Inside the eaves, in Gothic lettering, is an inscription:\n‘To the Glory of God\nAnd in memory of those\nWho laid down their lives\nFor their King and Country’.\nThe idea of a Lych Gate, familiar to prisoners from churchyards back in England, gave some feeling of dignity and respect for those who had died in appalling conditions. The Lych Gate is set in an area heavy with symbolism. It is the entrance now to the Far East Prisoners of War Grove. Most of the trees here are dedicated to individual FEPOWs, with some mentioning groups, such as the civilian and military women and children who perished and all the FEPOWs lost at sea while being transported.",

At Dettingen (1743) it won the distinction of wearing the oak leaf whilst parading for Royalty and also on certain Regimental days. The story is that the 22nd protected the king, who was commanding the field, from being taken prisoner by the French. The king picked a sprig of oak from a nearby tree and presented it to them.\nIn 1751 the Regimental was renamed, The 22nd Regiment of Foot. In 1782 all British Regiments without Royal titles were assigned a county title in order to aid recruitment, therefore the Regiment became the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment of Foot and later in 1881 re – titled The Cheshire Regiment\nDuring the course of the First World War, The Regiment was awarded 75 Battle Honours and 2 Victoria Crosses losing 8,413 men.\nIn WW2 the 1st the Battalion served in North Africa, Malta and North West Europe . The 2nd Battalion was evacuated from Dunkirk before fighting in North Africa, Sicily and Italy. It then landed on D-Day and fought in the North West Europe campaign.\nFollowing WW2 the 1st Battalion has served in numerous operational areas: Malaya, Cyprus, Northern Ireland, Bosnia under the United Nations and Iraq.\nIn 2007 the Regiment was amalgamated in with the Staffordshire and Worcestershire & Sherwood Regiments to form the Mercian Regiment the 1st Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire).\nThe memorial consists of a 2 foot plinth displaying the 138 battle honours and holds a large stone cut from a Sycamore quarry in Cheshire. The stone is flanked on both sides by steel cut-outs of soldiers representing the Regiments formation in1689 and amalgamation in 2007. It was dedicated in October 2022.",

    "description": "The Cheshire Yeomanry Memorial\n'Moving Forward, Looking Back' \nThis memorial was commissioned to coincide with the 225th anniversary of the raising of the Cheshire Yeomanry Regiment. With the constant uncertainties of future British Army structures and the unknown future threats of town planning, what better place to secure our memorial, for future generations of Cheshire Yeomen, than at the National Memorial Arboretum. We now have a permanent and fitting place to lay our wreaths and pay our respects to all our comrades. We have a focal point to be able to contemplate those that have gone before us. \nThe Cheshire Yeomanry was raised as a light cavalry regiment in 1797 under the threat of a Napoleonic invasion. The regiment has built a proud history during that period. Our role remains today as Light Cavalry and throughout its early history up to and during World War 2 the regiment served with its constant companion, the horse. Since then, we have had another type of companion, who has been our protection, our weapon, our shelter and our means of transport, the mechanised vehicle. Our memorial represents the strength and power of a horse, but at the same time represents through its design, examples of many of those other vehicles. \nDesigner and Sculptor - Joanne Risley (Sculptor) \n“I was very honoured to have been chosen to create the memorial sculpture for the Cheshire Yeomanry to celebrate 225 years since its inception. In response to the brief, I have designed a life-sized rearing war horse created using the mechanisms, structure and detail found on the Fox, Ferret and Jackal armoured vehicles. \nObjects of war mix with more familiar domestic objects such as a spade and the beloved ‘BV’ boiling vessel that provides the crew with hot water for tea and cooking. The plinth carries a turret wheel which frames the cast bronze regimental crest. I have tried to encapsulate the strength and dynamism of the animal with the armoured feel of the regiment’s vehicles. \nThe arboretum already features a highly naturalistic life-size horse so I wanted to create a unique and modern monument that would strike a different note. The regiment kindly provided historic context, photographic material and access to Fox Barracks where I was able to study one of the Jackal vehicles up close. At the Cheshire Military Museum the Fox and Ferret armoured vehicles provided further inspiration. \nThe body of the horse is tank-like and incorporates toeholds, wheel arches, rear lights and smoke canisters. The legs and thighs are formed from wheels and tyre treads with the helmet-like head supported by gun parts and a spine and ribs derived from the Jackal anti-roll system. \nThe whole sculpture stands 3m tall. Created from weathering steel, which contains copper and smaller bronze elements, the overall appearance will take on a rusted and aged appearance whilst the material’s unique properties provide a protective surface that will endure indefinitely. \nAs well as being of symbolic and emotional importance to the regiment, the horse embodies courage, freedom, power, endurance, personal drive, passion and heroism. The animal appears to be moving forward but looking back in order to represent soldiers of the regiment past and present. \nJoanne Risley studied Fine Art at Mid-Cheshire College, Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and then at The University of Ulster. \nShe was elected a member of Manchester Academy of Fine Art in 2017. www.joannerisley.co.uk \nMaterials Used - Rusted Corten steel, copper, and smaller bronze elements. \nAge of Memorial - The build was completed during 2021 and installed at the NMA in June 2022 and a dedication ceremony was held 12th June 2022. \nSymbolism - The Memorial has been created to allow visitors to remember those lost and to contemplate, surrounded by the memorials of all Yeomanry Regiments and positioned so that there is a full view from all angles of Yeomanry Avenue.",

The majority of funding was raised by an organisation called COFEPOW (Children of Far East Prisoners of War). COFEPOW came about after a lady named Carol Cooper, from Norfolk, read an article in a newspaper in 1994, concerning the diary of a former prisoner-of-war of the Japanese. She realised that this was the diary of her father who went to fight in the Far East when she was only 2 years old but had died working on the Burma railway.\n▪ After receiving a transcript of the diary, she went to Burma in an attempt to find his grave. Her journey was made into a documentary by the BBC. Many other children and relatives of such prisoners then contacted Carol and COFEPOW was formed in 1997. It took 3½ years to raise the funds, the same amount of time that the FEPOWs spent in the horrendous conditions of the prison camps. The building was officially opened on VJ Day 2005 the 60th anniversary of the end of the war in South East Asia. It is designed to take the shape of a prison hut. Inside there are exhibits and artefacts covering the experiences of the servicemen and civilians who were taken prisoner. In the far right-hand corner of the museum is a copy of the Java Windows. These are replicas of the two made by a British Naval officer whilst a prisoner]and were situated in a small chapel that the Japanese allowed them to have, mainly for propaganda purposes. A close inspection of the British coat of arms will reveal that the lion has the face of Winston Churchill. Knowing that their captors had not discovered this helped to keep up morale. The original windows still survive today and can be found in All Saints Church in Jakarta, Indonesia. Also, look for the names being projected onto the wall at the end of the museum.

In 1911 the Royal Navy graduated its first aeroplane pilots at the Royal Aero Club flying ground at RAF Eastchurch. \nIn 1912, naval and army aviation were combined to become the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The Naval Wing of the RFC lasted until July 1914 when the Royal Navy reformed its air branch, under the Air Department of the Admiralty, naming it the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). \nBy the outbreak of the First World War, in August 1914, the RNAS had more aircraft under its control than the remaining RFC. The roles of the RNAS were fleet reconnaissance, patrolling coasts for enemy ships and submarines and attacking enemy coastal territory. \nIn April 1918 the RNAS, which at this time had 67,000 officers and men, 2,949 aircraft, 103 airships and 126 coastal stations, merged with the RFC to form the Royal Air Force. \nIn 1924, the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force was formed, encompassing those RAF units that normally embarked on aircraft carriers and fighting ships. The year was significant for British naval aviation as only weeks before the founding of the Fleet Air Arm, the Royal Navy had commissioned HMS Hermes, the world's first ship to be designed and built as an aircraft carrier. \nIn 2009 the Royal Navy celebrated the centenary of Naval Aviation, and the memorial honours the sacrifice made by 6,749 men and women who gave their lives in the service of naval aviation over those 100 years. \nOver 80% of front-line Fleet Air Arm Squadrons are currently deployed on operations round the world. \nThe memorial is a sculptured plinth of Portland Stone supporting a granite aircraft carrier.

    "description": "Free Spirit Horse Memorial\nA tribute to the unique contribution made by horses throughout history in times of War. Recognising their continuing service to humankind in Work, Rehabilitation, Education, Sport and Leisure. In 2013 a group of people with a love of horses came together with a vision to create a memorial acknowledging the horse’s unfaltering service to humankind and to celebrate the unique relationship between horses and humans that exists through sport, history, work, rehabilitation, education and leisure. This beautiful sculpture and its carefully planned setting were unveiled in 2019, made possible through generous donations and the work of local craftspeople who contributed their skills to realising the vision of Free Spirit.\nFree Spirit is a unique project that embodies the inclusiveness that is reflected in the non-judgmental partnership between horse and human. Gartmore Riding School in Hammerwich and many contributors raised funds to create a life-sized bronze statue acknowledging the horse’s unfaltering service to humanity, to be displayed at the National Memorial Arboretum, Staffordshire. There are few people left today that remember the essential role the horse played through history and how until a generation ago the horse was part of everyday life. The memorial expresses endurance, service and partnership and represents determination and trust, inspiration for which came from young people. The project brought together individuals from all ages and backgrounds sharing the importance of the horse to different generations, ethnicities and religions. The groundwork has been carefully designed to welcome all visitors, regardless of mobility or disability, allowing all members of society to enjoy the memorial together. The provision of spaces between the seats creates multiple points of access for wheelchair users; a lower plinth height and plaques incorporating Braille and Makaton allow the visually impaired to enjoy the memorial through a tactile experience. Free Spirit brought the essential contribution that the horse has made to humanity to new audiences and generations in a number of projects, including art, music and history, and worked across the local community and beyond. The opportunity to meet a pony has never been easily accessible to many of the young people visiting by the project, and Free Spirit recognises that the unique relationship between horse and human can increase confidence and self-esteem, and that this connection leaves a legacy that continues to bring joy to this and future generations. The horse is part of our story, and the people involved in its inception and creation were particularly proud to see so many young people engaging with the project. Inspired by the thoughts and feelings of these young people, Birmingham songwriter Dominic Malin wrote a signature song for Free Spirit. The song embraces the qualities associated with the horse and the music reflects the past, engages with the present and carries a message into the future. It is an honour to have horses in our lives and Free Spirit represents this for centuries and generations to come.",

    "description": "The Green Howards Memorial Stone\nThe Concept\nThe Green Howards (Alexandra, Princess of Wales’s Own Yorkshire Regiment) was a British Army Infantry Regiment raised in 1688 by Colonel Francis Luttrell at Dunster Castle. It was based in Richmond, North Yorkshire and amalgamated for the first and only time in 2006 to form part of The Yorkshire Regiment.\nThe Green Howards has a vibrant Association with branches spread over North Yorkshire and Teesside and others as far away as London and Kent.\nAlthough The Green Howards is well served with memorials honouring its fallen up to 1945, particularly at its home in Richmond and at Crépon in Normandy, there was nothing in stone, other than The Armed Forces Memorial, where all those who died whilst serving on duty or were killed in action after 1945 are honoured.\nAn application was lodged with the NMA on 8th January 2019 to place an appropriate and proportionate stone dedicated to those Green Howards named on the Armed Forces Memorial. It was further deemed appropriate to commemorate all those who have served with the Regiment from the time of its raising.\nThe Design Team\nMajor Michael Pickard, a retired Green Howard, was invited to design the stone in June 2018. He was assisted by Colonel Clive Mantell and Major Tony Warriner, the Chairman and Secretary of the Green Howards Association. It was designed, quarried, carved and erected in time for a dedication service on the 165th anniversary of the Battle of the Alma on the 19th September 2019.\nThe Design\nThe stone is a waisted, square section, silver/grey granite column, approx. 6 feet 4 inches high, in three parts set on a stone paved base.The top part is a solid hand-carved Norwegian King’s Crown with polished extremities and honed on the inner surfaces.\nThe middle part is a plain polished truncated pyramidal form resting on four lower tapered faces.\nOn one face of the stone the lineage displayed creates a permanent and lasting record of the 318 years of its history above a dedication to all those who have served with the Regiment.\nOn the opposite face is a record of countries where the Regiment has served since 1945 above a dedication to the proud memory of those Green Howards killed in action or on duty and honoured on the Armed Forces Memorial.\nEverything on the stone is significant and interlinked:\n• The two badges (one from the first half of the 20th c and the other from the second half) show the cipher of HRH Alexandra, Princess of Wales, interlaced with the Dannebrog, surmounted by a princess’s coronet and the date 1875 when the Regiment was designated ‘The Princess of Wales’s Own’ (Thus starting the close connection with the Royal Houses of the Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway).\n• The crown at the top recognises the Kings of Norway who were Colonels-in-Chief from 1914 to 2006.\n• The Battle of the Alma, the principal battle honour, celebrated every year on, or near, the dedication day is included to emphasise the importance of this anniversary to the Regiment: 19th September 2019.\n•The 19th Regiment of Foot (XIX) features strongly because The Green Howards is one of just a handful of Line Regiments to retain its original designated number.\nMaterial and Construction\nThe silver/grey granite was quarried and cut to shape in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India and then carved and installed by Strongs Memorials Limited, 39 Park Road, Bloxwich, Walsall, West Midlands WS3 3SS\nProject leader: Andrew Hodgson. Inscription carving: Andrew Walsh. CAD: Mark Abesamis and Robin Mills.\nPosition\nThe stone is positioned 100 metres to the West of the Armed Forces Memorial and close to both the memorials of The Yorkshire Regiment and the Prince of Wales’s Own Yorkshire Regiment.",

The fifth ship, HMS Cossack – LO3, was arguably the most famous of the 16 Tribal Class destroyers that served with the Royal Navy during the Second World War. \nAs a large, heavily armed destroyer, HMS Cossack saw much action and was involved in the pursuit and sinking of the German battleship Bismarck in May 1941. On 23 October 1941, while escorting a convoy from Gibraltar to the United Kingdom, HMS Cossack was struck by a torpedo causing immense damage: 159 of her 219 crew were killed. She eventually sank on 27 October and survivors were picked up by HMS Legion, HMS Carnation and the Free French Ship Commandant. \nThe memorial bench is dedicated to Shipmate George Toomey, the founder of the HMS Cossack Association, and to the memory of all those who served in the Cossacks. \nTo the right of the memorial bench is the Cossack oak tree planted by the HMS Cossack Association in memory of the 159 officers and men who died in HMS Cossack 23 October 1941. The plaque commemorates all those who served in HM Ships Cossack 1938-1941 and 1945-1960.",

Returning to England in 1937, she served at Portsmouth as a Boys Sea Training Ship until August 1939 when she was allocated to the 12th Cruiser Squadron based on Kirkwall for service on the Northern Patrol. \nDunedin spent time hunting for German battleships and during 1940 was operating in the Caribbean Sea intercepting German merchant ships.

    "description": "HMS Formidable \nHMS Formidable was an Illustrious-class aircraft carrier (28,661 tons full load) that saw extensive service during the Second World War. She was commissioned on 24 November 1940.\nHMS Formidable took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 27 March 1941. On 26 May 1941, she received serious damage while transporting aircraft to Malta, being hit by two 1000-kilogram bombs that put her out of action for six months. After repairs in the United States, she re-equipped with Vought Corsair and Martlet fighters.\nIn 1942, she travelled across the Pacific and served briefly in the Indian Ocean, returning to the Mediterranean in October. HMS Formidable then provided air support for the North African campaign and Italian campaign (1943), including the Allied invasion of Sicily, before taking part in an Arctic convoy. On 17 November aircraft from HMS Formidable attacked U-Boat U-331 (the U-Boat that sank HMS Barham) and sank her.\nOn 17 July 1944, Swordfish aircraft from HMS Formidable were involved in an attack on the Tirpitz in Norway and took part in further attacks on Tirpitz in August.\nDuring 1945 she saw service against Japanese forces with British Pacific Fleet and survived several kamikaze attacks while supporting the landings on Okinawa. On 4 May a Japanese kamikaze plane crashed into the flight deck, making a massive dent about 10 feet long, two feet wide and two feet deep in the armoured flight deck. A large steel splinter ruptured a steam line, and came to rest in a fuel tank, starting a major fire in the aircraft park. Eight crew members were killed and forty-seven were wounded: the 3\" armoured steel flight deck of HMS Formidable prevented further damage by Kamikaze attacks. By 5pm the fires were brought under control, the crater in the deck was repaired and Corsairs were again able to land on Formidable. A further Kamikaze hit HMS Formidable's flight deck on 9 May, but the level of damage was nowhere near as serious.\nThe accumulation of damage through the war took its toll on the ship. The bomb damage received in the Mediterranean had left her with damage that was beyond economical repair. She was placed in reserve in 1947 and was sold for scrap in 1953.\nThe blue plaque on the face of the stone memorial contains details of HMS Formidable’s Battle Honours and a reference to Lieutenant Robert Hampton Gray VC, DSC, RCNVR of 1841 Squadron - a Canadian naval officer, pilot, and posthumous recipient of the last Victoria Cross (VC) of the Second World War. Robert Hampton Gray is thought to be one of the last Canadians to die during the Second World War.\nLocated behind the main memorial to HMS Formidable is an oak tree which was planted by the HMS Formidable Association on 22 September 2001 and commemorates in tribute “all who served in and flew from this great ship”.",

Commissioned on 16 February 1975 the Sheffield was part of the Task Force 317 sent to the Falkland Islands. \nOn May 4 1982, the 4,100-ton destroyer was struck by a missile fired from an Argentine fighter bomber as it carried out a scouting mission off the Falklands - which Argentina had invaded and claimed as their own weeks earlier. \nThe ship caught fire when a French-made Exocet missile hit HMS Sheffield and went deep into its control room. \nThe blaze caused a poisonous smoke to be released and most of the crew abandoned ship. \nThe “Shiny Sheff” \nThe Shiny Sheff memorial honours the service of all those who served in the three ships of that name over 65 years and the 20 members of the Ship’s Company killed in action during the Falklands Conflict in 1982: \nThe Cruiser (C24) 1937-67. World War 11 service \nThe Destroyer (D80) 1970-82. Gulf and Falklands conflict \nThe Frigate (F96) 1986-2002. Gulf. Awarded the Wilkinson Sword of Peace \nIn 2020 with the 40th anniversary of the Falklands Conflict rapidly approaching the HMS SHEFFIELD Association agreed that a memorial should be placed at the National Memorial Arboretum to honour all those who served in the three ships of that name and that there should also be a place of remembrance for the 20 men lost when the second vessel of the name was damaged in action on the 4th of May 1982. In the spring of 2021, the artist Peter Naylor was commissioned to design a memorial which reflected all three ships and their close association with the city of Sheffield and its industries. The City of Sheffield Master Cutler was approached for assistance in making the memorial. The fabrication of the memorial was led by William Cook steel casting and supported by Tinsley Bridge, Outokumpu, and Charles Day Steels. The Association are extremely proud that their memorial was made of stainless steel by skilled craftsmen in the city of Sheffield. The memorial consists of a stainless-steel bow of a warship set in a stainless steel base, within in the deconstructed cruiser’s crest. The circular crest on the top of the memorial represents both destroyer and frigate. \nMaterials Used \nSheffield Stainless steel cast and sheet \nThe memorial was constructed in January to April 2022 with ground-breaking in April 2022, it was unveiled by Mrs Penny Salt, widow of Captain Sam Salt, the Commanding Officer of the Destroyer HMS SHEFFIELD during the Falklands conflict. Mrs Salt consecrated the memorial on the 4th of May 2022 with a bottle of sea water collected in the South Atlantic by HMS Forth. \nSymbolism \nPositioned close to the South Atlantic Memorial and the corner of the Naval Field the memorial links the South Atlantic conflict with the large part played in that conflict by the Royal Navy and supporting Maritime services. \nThe design of the memorial and its manufacture in stainless steel proudly links all three ships with the City of Sheffield and its world-famous steel industries. When they were constructed all three warships were presented with ship’s bells and fittings of stainless steel made in Sheffield. \nThe memorial represents a warship at speed as it cuts through a dull grey sea during operations. The sea is set in the deconstructed pentagonal crest of the cruiser which links the second world war generation of sailors to the modern era. \nThe warship crest on the top of the memorial takes the sheaf of arrows from the city of Sheffield Coat of Arms. The sheaf of arrows is a wordplay on the river Sheaf which runs through Sheffield and is also a reference to the iron and steel making heritage of the city. ",

Lancastria was carrying both service personnel and civilians; it is unknown how many were on board at the time but some estimates are up 9,000. This was such a catastrophe that that Churchill ordered a “D Notice” - a total news blackout - for fear of the damage this may do to the country's morale. \nIn WW2 many ocean-going pleasure liners were requisitioned by the British Government to support the war effort. \nHMT Lancastria's capacity was 1,300 passengers, it was deployed to St Nazaire, France, to assist in the evacuation of British Nationals and troops from France, two weeks after Dunkirk. \nOn the 17 June 1940 it was agreed to load 3,000 onto the ship but that number increased during the boarding, estimated between 5,000 and 9,000. \nThe Captain of Lancastria could have left port around 14:00 but the RN destroyer which was to escort it had been bombed by the Germans. \nSo Lancastria's Captain decided to wait for an escort. Index \nUnfortunately, while waiting, a fresh air raid began at around 16:00 and Lancastria was hit by three or possibly four bombs. \nA number of survivors reported that one of the bombs had gone down the ships only funnel causing the ship to sink quickly - around 15-20 minutes. \nOpinions differ on actual loss of life but the general consensus is at least 3,000, up to around 7,000. \nA simple stone memorial is located in front of the ‘Lancastria Oak’ within the Merchant Navy Woodland, bearing a circular plaque inscribed with the Lancastria Association badge and emblem. \nThe story of the Lancastria is little known but represents the biggest disaster in British maritime history. \nOn 17 June 1940, the 16,000-ton Cunard liner Lancastria lay five miles off St Nazaire embarking troops, RAF personnel and civilian refugees, including women and children, who were being evacuated from France, which was then on the point of collapse. The exact number of people on board may never be known, but almost certainly exceeded 6,000; some estimates were as high as 9,000. \nThe Lancastria was attacked and hit by bombs from German aircraft. The ship sank rapidly and, according to the estimate of the Commanding Officer, Captain Rudolf Sharpe, only around 2,500 of those on board were saved. \nDue to the scale of the tragedy and in the interests of public morale (this also being the day that the French government decided to seek an armistice with Nazi Germany), Winston Churchill forbade publication of the news at the time, hence the story of the Lancastria has never been generally known, although it is Britain’s worst maritime disaster. \nSince the Second World War, the Lancastria Association and Lancastria Association of Scotland have established memorials to the victims and carry out remembrance services every year.

The original idea for this garden was to create an acre of Ireland in the heart of the British Isles. The paved map of Ireland commemorates each of the Irish regiments. \nIn WW1 37 VCs were awarded. In WW2 8 VCs were awarded. \nThe youngest ever recorded British soldier to have died was an Irish lad named John Condon, aged 14yrs. He died on 24 May 1915 at the 2nd battle of Ypres and is buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery at Poelkapelle. On his stone it clearly states his age as 14 years. \nAll the trees and shrubs in the garden are of Irish origin.

The request found Captain Percy Scott RN in Simons Bay. His crew had, in 24 hours, prepared two 4.7-inch guns and four 12-pounders for land warfare. Under the command of Captain Hedworth Lambton RN, the Naval Brigade set out over land for Ladysmith. Crews from HMS Powerful and HMS terrible were formed for this task. \nAfter oxen failed to haul the guns across the rough terrain, only one option was left. The Naval Brigade (Bluejackets) had to haul the guns by muscle power themselves and still managed to arrive within 48 hours. Soon after their arrival at Ladysmith the siege of 119 days began. More men from the ships set out with more guns of both 4.7” and 12-pounders with a six in monster called “ROMA”. \nThe Determination, Teamwork and Dedication of the Bluejackets captured the public’s hearts back home and, on the ships, return the Naval Brigades were to be paraded. This was so popular that the following year a tournament was staged at the 1900 Military Tournament at the Royal Agricultural Hall in Islington, London. The Field Gun Competition was born. \nLater the Royal Tournament moved to Olympia and then to Earl’s Court. Earl’s Court became the home to the Command Field Gun Competition with crews from the ports of Chatham (CHATS), Devonport (GUZZ), Portsmouth (POMPEY) and Fleet Air Arm (Air), who joined much later in 1947.

British prisoners of war captured at the fall of Hong Kong were being transported to Japan to work as slaves. After their ship was torpedoed the Japanese rescued their own troops but locked the POWs in the holds leaving them to drown, and shot at those who managed to break out. In 1942 the Japanese began sending POWs from their captured territories to Japan to work as slave labour in various industries so as to free up the workforce to be enlisted into the armed forces. The second shipment of POWs from Hong Kong was on the Lisbon Maru. On 27 September 1942 the Lisbon Maru, a Japanese armed freighter with Japanese troops on board, sailed from Hong Kong bound for Japan. It also carried 1,816 British prisoners of war held in atrocious conditions. Cramped, airless, and in unimaginable squalor they were incarcerated below deck in three cargo holds. The freighter bore no markings to indicate their presence. On 1 October an American submarine, the USS Grouper, on patrol off the Zhoushan archipelago in the East China Sea, engaged the Lisbon Maru holing it below the waterline with a torpedo. Although initially taken under tow, the line snapped and the ship drifted and foundered. The Japanese evacuated their troops, battened down the hatches over the holds and left a guard force to prevent the prisoners from escaping. For 24 hours the prisoners were held in sub-human conditions in darkness with no food, water, fresh air or sanitation; and dysentery was rife. There was a breakout before the ship sank the next day and many of the prisoners of war escaped from the two forward holds, some of whom were cut down by machine-gun fire. Most of those in the third hold, by then below the waterline, tragically drowned. Those who did escape were shot at in the water as they attempted to swim to the shore; many were killed or wounded but local Chinese fishermen courageously rescued 384 of the survivors. Later, the Japanese recaptured all but three.\nOf the original 1,816 men on board 828 died in this terrible atrocity and a further 200 or more succumbed from their sufferings within a few months.",

Additionally, the wood was planted with bluebells to represent the sea. \nThe ships cargoes included food, troops, armaments, ammunition and fuel carried to the United Kingdom and every theatre of war. The seafarers were civilians who faced the enemy and the sea with equal bravery and courage, to keep the supply lines open to Britain and its allies.",

Mesothelioma is a cancer caused by asbestos that affects around 2,700 people in the UK each year. A number of those diagnosed are, or were, serving members of the Armed Forces. As part of a Government-funded project, national charity, Mesothelioma UK supported research into the effects of mesothelioma within our armed forces. Findings from the research informed the development of the charity’s UK-wide specialist service for armed forces personnel and veterans who have been affected by mesothelioma. As part of the project, the charity wanted to create a memorial to honour those who have lost their lives to the disease or are living with it. The memorial depicts building blocks of life, engraved with information about mesothelioma, asbestos and our Armed Forces. \nMaterials Used\nAncaster Weatherbed limestone\nName of Designers\nGraeme Mitcheson M.M.R.S.\nAge of Memorial\nThe construction began in spring 2023. A dedication ceremony is due to be held in October 2023.\nSymbolism and meaning\nThe building blocks of life are represented by solid blocks of carved stone, constructed in a format not dissimilar to the game Jenga. The sculpture shows that even though the tower of blocks has been damaged in the middle, it is strongly supported above and below. This represents the aims of the charity. In addition to the tall tower of blocks. Each face will have carved across the surface of the stone, an inscription that describes both the aims of Mesothelioma UK and details of the disease. Some of the sections are slightly jumbled as the blocks have collapsed. The inscriptions are designed in such a way that the viewer is compelled to study the jumbled words and to try to rearrange the sentences in their heads, all the time learning a little about the charity and about mesothelioma. The Memorial has been created to allow families and friends of those affected to be able to visit the memorial and pay their respects or celebrate a key milestone.",

All are invited to participate and reflect on the sacrifice of those who have given their lives in the service of their country. The Chapel is constructed largely from wood, reflecting the environment surrounding it, and the National Memorial Arboretum’s commitment to sustainability. The roof is supported by 12 columns of Douglas fir, each carved with one of the 12 disciples, by ex-Royal Marine and Shropshire woodcarver Jim Heath. \nAt the entrance to the Chapel, the Millennium Prayer written by 13 year-old competition winner Anna Crompton is carved into cherry wood. The chapel’s altar, along with the lectern and pulpit, was made locally by young oŽenders at Swinfen Hall Prison. The altar cloth, showing the Tree of Life, was commissioned by the Women’s Section of the Royal British Legion, intended to remind us of the passing seasons. The altar candlesticks were created by Robert Pritchard-Gordon, a Birmingham silversmith, who collaborated with Arthur Price, the internationally reputed tableware company and Robert Carr, a Lichfield jeweller. These represent the twelve knives used by apostles. They are bound by barbed wire as a reminder that people still starve as a result of war and imprisonment \nOn the wall behind the altar are three crosses. The central one is the ‘Sword of Sacrifice’, found at Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries. Either side of this are crosses made from the wood of trees actually grown in the Arboretum. The uprights are made of ash taken from trees in the Ulster Ash Grove and the crosspieces are made of hazel taken from trees in the Royal Army Medical Corps Wood.",

It is comprised of 13 coloured glass panels on a white granite terrace and includes a figure of Kilkenny limestone. \nThe glass depicts the colours of the five oceans – steel grey with spume lines for the Atlantic, turquoise for the Indian, ultramarine for the Pacific and white for the Arctic and Southern oceans. \nYellow is for the rising sun, red for the setting sun and the blood spilled at sea, and on land. \nOn the memorial’s terrace stands a figure of a sailor, head bowed in respect to shipmates everywhere, cap held in the ‘at ease’ position. The figure faces west, where the sun sets. The terrace has a carved inscription of the Tennyson poem ‘Crossing the Bar’ – a phrase used when shipmates pass away. \nThe glass panels cast a shadow suggesting the shape of a warship. Visible only in sunlight and for a few hours per day, it is best seen on 11 November. \nThe curved shapes suggest waves and motion while the scale and colour hint at sails in a harbour. The idea for the ‘warship shadow’ came when the designer was in his garden, on a summer’s day, watching shadows cast by washing hanging on the line. \nThe Naval Service Memorial was unveiled on 15 June 2014 by HRH Prince Michael of Kent. \nThe coloured glass memorial was commissioned by the Royal Naval Association to mark the 60th anniversary of its being granted a Royal Charter. \nThe 13 glass panels depict the different colours of the oceans of the world, while yellow is for the rising sun and red the setting sun. There are also splashes of red representing the blood spilled at sea, on land and in the air in defence of our nation. \nThe panels cast a shadow, suggesting the shape of a warship, which is best seen around lunchtime when the sun is directly behind. \nThe single figure faces the setting sun, head bowed, and cap held in the 'at ease' position, showing respect to his fallen shipmates. \nOn the terrace edge is a carved inscription from the Tennyson poem 'Crossing the Bar', which is the phrase used by Navy personnel when a shipmate has passed away.

She called on the Matron and asked if she had a few lonely patients who would like to come out for tea. The Matron looked surprised and replied that there were in fact 600 injured patients lying in the hospital, with many more across the country. Marta was horrified by what she saw. \nAn avid charity worker during the Great War, Marta soon set about contacting her friends to organise tea parties, concerts and outings for those able to attend. During one of these early invitations one injured soldier said: “We don’t want no charity Miss, we are forgotten by everybody and we’d better stop so.” But, undeterred, in August 1920, Marta formed the “NOT FORGOTTEN” Association for the ‘comfort, cheer and entertainment’ of the war wounded and within a year some 10,000 men had been entertained. \nThe memorial is made of solid green polished granite with a sculptured elephant’s head on top. The elephant and sword form the basis of the emblem of the association. \nThe plaque on the ground outlines the part of Marta Cunningham in setting up the Association. \nThe Not Forgotten Association is a charity that continues to provide events for wounded serving personnel and disabled veterans, which improve physical and mental health, address isolation and loneliness, and provide a sense of community and balance.",

Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who is the Grand Prior of the Order of St John, officially opened the memorial in 2009; however, it took some fourteen years to completion and was not finally completed until 2022. \nThe design of the memorial takes the form of the St John (Amalfi) Cross. The entrance is through one of the arms of the cross which is flanked by two granite panels depicting the badge of St John and the Priory of England and the Islands. At the centre of the cross is a black granite stone with the inscription: “In honour of all those who have faithfully served the Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem and its foundations.” \nThe other various priory emblems are fixed to the arms of the memorial in order of precedence (It should be noted that because the cross was designed to give a particular perspective when viewed from the front, the tops of the walls which form the arms of the cross are slanted and therefore are not necessarily horizontal. In order to ensure that all the plaques are in line with each other when the monument is viewed as a whole, individual plaques will not always be parallel to the tops of the respective wall to which they are attached.) \nThe Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem shares its origins with the religious Knights Hospitaller, who served in a hospice in Jerusalem which looked after pilgrims in the twelfth century. The English branch was dissolved by King Henry VIII in 1540 and briefly reinstated by Queen Mary in 1557. An early 19th century move to revive the Order in England eventually resulted in the creation of a British Royal Order of Chivalry. Her Majesty Queen Victoria granted the Order of St John a Royal Charter and became its Sovereign Head in 1888. The Order, as an Order of Chivalry, is unique in its corporate work for the benefit of society. It has two key foundations: the St John of Jerusalem Eye Hospital and St John Ambulance. \nThe Order conducts its affairs around the world through the St John Eye Hospital Group, 11 Priories, 5 Commanderies and 32 Associations. The Priory of England and the Islands manages the day-to-day affairs of Order business in England, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. The Priory’s main role is delivered by its subsidiary charity StJohn Ambulance which delivers first aid and first aid training in the community. It also carries out Ambulance work in support of the NHS, and has a thriving Youth movement. \nThe Order is also involved in welfare services alongside the British Red Cross Society of the International Red Cross through a residential home for ex servicemen and women, ex-nurses and ex-members of St John and the Red Cross. The welfare of patients in Service Hospitals is looked after by the Order of St John and British Red Cross Defence Medical Welfare Service. Furthermore, in association with the British Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, through the Orders of St John Care Trust the Priory promotes the Trust’s work with residential care homes and alms houses. The Order’s Museum is located at St John’s Gate in Clerkenwell, London. There is also a flourishing St John Fellowship with branches throughout England and the Islands, as well operating in many of the overseas priories and associations.",

Here you will see a paviour dedicated to him and a larger one to Don Finlay the Olympic athlete who was also an apprentice. \nAnother example of how people or organisations can be remembered the plaque and tree in honour of Sergeant Thomas GRAY, a former Halton Apprentice, who lost his life in 1940 when the plane in which he was navigator was shot down after a bombing raid to destroy a bridge in Belgium. \nHe was awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery and his skill in navigating to the correct target, which they bombed successfully. \nSergeant Gray had 6 brothers, 3 of whom were also killed in action during WW2. \nBy pushing the buttons on the information board, you can hear audio presentations about some of the events and people involved at RAF Halton over the years. \nRAF Halton is still operational and nowadays provides training for most new recruits to the RAF, plus highly specialised training for members of all 3 armed services.

It remained there until 2011, when it was relocated to the Arboretum, as the Corps’ centre of gravity was \nno longer in Aldershot.

On instructions from Athena, he sowed the dragon’s teeth in the ground and a race of fierce men sprang up called Sparti. The RADC provides dental services to members of the British Army.

It is not primarily a memorial to those who made the ultimate sacrifice, although it serves that purpose as well, but it embraces everyone who served in the Corps. It is a project of regimental significance, supported by generous donations from our membership. \nMaterials Used \nThe plinth is made of Cumbrian Sandstone. The two books of regulation which surmount it are Forest of Dean sandstone. The plinth dimensions are 1300mm (l) x 800mm (w) x 1850mm (h) with a 300mm granite apron surrounding the monument. \nThe lion was cast in bronze in Birmingham and then nickel plated. \nName of Designers \nNick Johnson – Master Monument Mason. \nAndy DeComyn – Sculptor. \nAge of Memorial \nIn 2022, Nick Johnson (Master Monument Mason) and Andy DeComyn (Sculptor) were appointed by the Trustees of the RAPC Regimental Association, with ground broken on site a year later. The dedication ceremony was held on 14th June 2023. \nSymbolism \nThe memorial shows a lion standing atop the two most commonly-used books of reference for the RAPC - the Regulations for Army Allowances and Charges and the Manual of Army Pay Duties. The lion is guarding a bag of coin, which lies open between its front paws. \nThis represents the RAPC’s twin roles; it was both the Army’s guardian of the public purse, ensuring that monies were properly disbursed and correctly accounted for, but also the soldier’s guarantor of receiving fair, accurate and timely pay and allowances – not things that could be taken for granted in previous ages. \nThe plinth is carved with the four cap badges that make up our formal antecedence, although the role itself dates back many centuries: \nThe Army Pay Department \nThe Army Pay Corps \nThe Corps of Military Accountants \nThe Royal Army Pay Corps (prior to being granted the regimental motto Fide Et Fiducia) \nThe RAPC Memorial features prominently on the Army Parade next to the Beat. It offers those who served in the RAPC a place to contemplate their service and to remember old comrades – the RAPC was a widely-dispersed corps in which you served with every part of the Army but seldom with the same RAPC friends. It also offers families a unique opportunity to go somewhere to respect the service given by a relative who served in the RAPC.

    "description": "The Royal Dragoon Guards Regimental Memorial \nThe Royal Dragoon Guards – ‘Our Castle, Our Strength and Shield’. The Royal Dragoon Guards was formed in 1992, as a result of the amalgamation of the 4/7th Royal Dragoon Guards and the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards. \nThe two antecedent regiments were themselves the result of amalgamations in 1922. The 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards formed from amalgamation of the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards and the 7th (Princess Royal’s) Dragoon Guards, and the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards formed from amalgamation of the 5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales’) Dragoon Guards and the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons. \nAll four of the original antecedent regiments were raised between 1685 and 1689, during the protracted contest for the English throne between James II and William of Orange. \nThis memorial is dedicated to all those who fought, served and died while serving in The Royal Dragoon Guards and its antecedent regiments, from 1685 to the present day. Accordingly, the memorial carries the cap badges of the regiments, together with the motto of The Royal Dragoon Guards: Quis Separabit (who shall separate us), which is taken from the eighth chapter of St Paul’s Letter to the Romans. \nAge of Memorial \nThe current memorial replaces an earlier memorial installed in 2008. The trustees of the Regimental Charity, informed by both the serving and veteran cohorts of the Regiment, agreed the original memorial failed to capture the spirit and tradition of the Regiment and those who had served it. The current memorial was dedicated on Saturday 11 March 2023. \nSymbolism \nThe Memorial is cut in the shape of a castle, to represent the Watergate that forms part of the ramparts of Enniskillen Castle, where the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons were raised in 1689. \nA device representing the Watergate was worn on the uniforms of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons and later, embroidered onto their Regimental Guidon in 1751, when the first regulations standardising regimental dress were introduced. The Watergate continued to be worn on the uniform of the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards and to be carried on its Regimental Standard. Today, the Watergate is carried on the Regimental Standard of The Royal Dragoon Guards and forms the centrepiece of the Regimental cap badge, mounted in the centre of the Star of St Patrick, the cap badge of the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards and later the 4/7th Royal Dragoon Guards. \nGreen was the regimental colour worn on the facings, (collar and cuffs) of the 5th Dragoon Guards and continued in the uniform of the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards. Today, that tradition continues in the colour of the Regiment’s beret, and the trousers worn with barrack, service and ceremonial dress. \nThe engravings on the face of the memorial represent the cap badges of the antecedent regiments. \nThe 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards and 4/7th Royal Dragoon Guards using the Star of St Patrick: the former with a shamrock surmounting the cross of St Patrick and the Regimental Motto, Quis Separabit, in the surrounding garter; the latter has the Princess Royal’s coronet at its centre, surmounting the cross of St George. \nThe 5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales’) Dragoon Guards has the white horse of Hannover at its centre, surrounded by the letter V representing the Roman number 5 and the letters DG to represent Dragoon Guards. Around the garter is the Regimental motto, Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum (Never a Rearward Step). \nThis also served as the motto of the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards, whose cap badge was a monogram of the 5th Dragoon Guards, surmounted by the reigning monarch’s crown. \nThe cap badge of the 7th (Princess Royal’s) Dragoon Guards depicts a lion rampant surmounting the Princess Royal’s coronet. The lion rampant was the family crest of Lord Ligonier, who commanded the Regiment in 1720. The Regiment was renamed the 7th Dragoon Guards in 1788, the name carried in the scroll below the Princess Royal’s coronet. \nLastly, the Watergate of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, flying the flag of St George mounted on a scroll carrying the name Inniskilling (the Island of Kathleen), which is the traditional Irish spelling for the town of Enniskillen. \nBelow the cap badges, in silver, is the Regimental Motto (Quis Separabit). This was the original motto of the Order of St Patrick, created by King George III in 1783. This chivalrous order lasted until the partition of Ireland in 1922, although King Charles III remains the Sovereign of the Order to this day. His Majesty King Charles III is the current Colonel in Chief of the Regiment.",

    "description": "ROYAL TANK REGIMENT \nThe tank was developed simultaneously in Britain and France. The idea for the caterpillar tracks came from British agriculture.\nBecause of the stalemate in WW1 where both sides were dug into trenches and unable to advance more than a few yards at a time, it was thought that the tank would break the stalemate. Because of its design, it could travel and crush the barbed wire fences, drive across the trenches and could turn the guns onto the enemy.\nThe tank when being moved around the country for trials was packed in large wooden cases and as a security measure it was marked \"water tank\". The name on the drawing board was originally \"land ship\" but when it came to be named, they decided to drop the water and call it a tank, on the premise that you put things in a tank i.e. men and munitions. (there are other versions of how this came about).\nOn the plinth is a scale model of a Mark 5 tank from WWI, of which there were 2 main types - the ‘female’ tank armed with machine guns and the ‘male’ armed with cannons. There were a few ‘hermaphrodites’, armed with both.\nThe trees on the plot are largely of Ash to correspond with the Ash ‘swagger sticks’ of the officers. These came about after an officer cut a branch from an ash tree to measure the depth of mud before sending his tanks into it, a clever idea which became general practice.\nThe oak tree, surrounded by the seat, was grown from an acorn collected from Delville Wood, on the Somme battlefield, where the tanks were used in larger numbers. Other trees are from the Cambrai battlefield, Flesquieres and Bourlon Wood, where the Battle of Cambrai took place in November 1917.\nAt the sides of the plot in spring, daffodils flower in the pattern of a tank’s caterpillar tracks.\nThe flag of the Tank Regiment is 3 horizontal stripes, from the bottom upwards, brown to red to green. Stands for, “from the mud through the blood to the green fields beyond”. The Moto of the RTD is “Fear Naught” 4 Members of the RTG have been awarded the VC, one being awarded to 2nd Lieutenant Clement Robertson who walked in front of his tanks to mark the way over heavily ploughed fields so as they not lose their way.\nThe first successful tank battle took place at Cambrai in 1917 with about 300 Mark IV tanks. Horrendous conditions inside the tank, temperature of up to 45 degrees, crew of 8, noise from shells, engine and tracks. 3-4 mph over shell craters, the smell. They needed a strong stomach. The tank on the plinth is a Mark V (male).\nIn the centre of the circular seat is an oak tree, the acorn was brought back from Delville Wood. Ash trees are significant as the Officers would walk in front of the tanks with sticks made of ash, they prodded the ground to see how firm it was as tanks used to get bogged down. Officers of the Regiment carry ‘swagger’, sticks.\nIn the early 2000s 2 coach loads of recruits were brought to the Grove. They planted daffodil bulbs in straight lines to resemble the tank tracks.\nTheir flag is brown, red and green, ‘through mud and blood to pastures new’.\nIn WW2 37% of tank casualties were reported to be soldiers leaving the tank to brew up. Since 1945 all tanks have been fitted with a boiling vessel to make tea.\nIn WW2, tanks played a major part in the war - there were 46 variants, tanks of all shapes and sizes. There were:\nTankettes, about the size of a large car, mainly used for reconnaissance.\nMedium size tanks, but not very successful, under gunned and armoured.\nLight tanks, used mainly for training\nCruiser tanks, used mainly against enemy tanks\nInfantry tanks, designed and heavily armoured, used to give close support to infantry unit. The most popular of these tanks appears to be the Churchill tank of which around 5,600 were manufactured.",

    "description": "FALKLANDS MEMORIAL (South Atlantic Medal Association) \nIn 1982, the Argentinians invaded the Falkland Islands; they have long believed the islands belonged to them and refer to them as The Malvinas. Britain's response was to send a Task Force to liberate them, whilst this was successful, it came at a price, and 255 service personnel lost their lives. \nAs war was never declared this is referred to as the Falklands Conflict not war. \nThe purpose of this memorial is threefold: \n1. To honour the Task Force; \n2. To remember those who gave their lives; \n3. To inform visitors about this important event in our history. \nThe rocks are from the Falklands, and the Azaleas are a species created by a local garden centre called \"Azalea Antelope\" in memory of HMS Antelope, a Type 2l Frigate lost in the conflict. \nThe plaque on the reverse of the central rock commemorates the 3 female Falkland Islanders who lost their lives during the conflict. \nThe wall of Cotswold stone is modelled on the memorial that stands at San Carlos Cemetery. The central plaque on the wall shows the crest of Joint Service Operations, which is flanked by the 6 services that played a role in the conflict. \nThe plaque at the base of the wall shows an outline map of the Atlantic Oceans and gives an indication of the vast distances the Task Force had to travel before engaging the Argentinians. \nSome stats: \nHuman losses: 255 British; 3 islanders; 649 Argentinians. \nShip losses: 4 - HM Ships Sheffield; Ardent; Antelope; Coventry. Argentinian ARA Belgrano \nMerchant Navy ship losses: I - Atlantic Conveyor with its cargo. \nRoyal Fleet Auxiliary ships losses: 2 - Sir Tristram and Sir Galahad; 56, mostly Welsh Guards, died on the latter \n\nAt the time of her sinking Captain Hart-Dyke was the Captain of HMS Coventry, his daughter is Maranda Hart the actress and comedian",

    "description": "The Submariner Memorial \nIn 1921 the sum of £2130 was raised by public subscription to create a “Memorial tablet to the Officers and Men of the Submarine Service R.N.” on the Embankment. It was dedicated in June 1922 and remains a very important place in the hearts and minds of all submariners. Yet the Embankment is not the most peaceful nor easiest place to meet for collective or private acts of remembrance or for quiet reflection. Moreover, the Embankment Memorial recognises submarines lost in the two world wars but not the submariners lost since then. \nIn the years since its opening the National Memorial Arboretum has grown into the centre of national remembrance and all armed and public services and many of their units and branches have placed memorials on this site. Indeed, the Submariners Association placed a small plaque here to submarines lost in the wars and another to our VC winners when the Arboretum opened. \nIn recent years, however, there has been a growing call for a more fitting memorial for the nearly 6000 submariners who have given their lives in service and, for the first time, to have a memorial which recognises the sacrifice of their families. This was acknowledged in July 2019 when a group of retired submariners came together to form a charity - The Submariner Memorial Appeal. \nThe aim was not only to raise funds, plan and install a new memorial, but in the process to bring the disparate elements of the submarine community together. The appeal was launched by the then Second Sea Lord in front of HMS ANSON in Devonshire Dock Hall at BAES Barrow-in-Furness on 28 February 2020 and a public competition to find ideas to inspire a professional designer announced. \nFrom over 600 entries, three age category winners and one overall winner were chosen and their designs given to three carefully selected professional sculptors. The sculptors were given wide latitude to be inspired by the winning entries but not to have to reproduce them. The resulting designs were all very different but all impressive, however, Paul Day’s entry immediately engaged the Board’s emotions and caught the spirit of the submarine service. \nWhilst Paul progressed the detailed design and casting of the memorial, fundraising ramped up. Around £500,000 would be needed. The appeal was very lucky to receive two particularly significant donations from the Gosling Foundation and from an anonymous donor. Submarine Industries were also very generous with 21 separate companies contributing. Livery companies, the Freemasons, the Royal Naval Royal Marine Charity, the RN Association and our submarine charities all supported the appeal and many individual contributions were made through crowd funding and a wealth of individual fundraising activities. These included running, rowing, cycling, painting, drawing, printing, coining (selling commemorative coins), writing, merchandising and more. The standout individual effort was Mr Graham Bishop who completed the London Marathon dressed as a model of a submarine.The money was raised in time for the turf to be cut by Diana Mayes, 100yr old widow of Lt Gordon Noll, CO of HMS UNTAMED and a young submariner from HMS VIGILANT on 6 September 2021. \nThe memorial itself is 3500kg of bronze sculpted into a divided fin of a submarine with the lone figure of a submariner standing between the two halves looking to the surface. On one outer side of the fin is a frieze of families waiting for the return of their loved ones and on the other fin the Churchill quote: \n“Of all the branches of men in the forces there is none which shows more devotion and faces grimmer perils than the submariners.” \nThe memorial is on a long low mound to give the idea that the rest of the boat is just below the water. An interpretation board is sited by its ‘port bow’. On this is a QR code which links to a new Online Book of Remembrance gifted to the Appeal by the Friends of the RN Submarine Museum. \nThis is a very significant piece of work in it is own right, it features the most detailed and well researched list of those who gave their lives in service in submarines. It will allow people to add stories and photographs of those whom they have lost and the QR code will be shared with all the other submarine memorials (over 60) around the country. Funds have been set aside to add it to the Embankment Memorial as well. \nThe Submarine Service was formed in 1901 when 6 officers and a number of ratings started submarine training. That same year the British Government placed an order for 5 American Holland class submarines to be built under licence by Vickers Sons and Maxim Ltd at Barrow-in-Furness. HMS Holland 1 launched in January 1902. \nAlthough some senior personnel within the Admiralty saw little point in submarines, Britain pursued an energetic submarine programme and by 1910 had 61 operational submarines. \nSubmarines played a major role in both world Wars and a total of 14 VCs were awarded to submariners. \nFrom the start of the submarine programme, a total of 174 submarines have been lost - the majority during the two World Wars. The last submarine to sink was in 1971 when HMS Artemis sank alongside the jetty at HMS Dolphin during refuelling. ",

Being so close to the front line, lots of officers' bars sprang up and bars for other ranks. Brothels also appeared. Talbot House was an alternative place for soldiers who wanted a quiet refuge. \nTalbot House was set up in 1915 by a jovial clergyman, the Rev. ‘Tubby’ Clayton providing basic comforts and a chapel for young men going to and from the Western Front. It was a ‘home from home’ where rank had no place. \nThe name ‘Talbot House’ was shortened to Toc H by use of the phonetic alphabet of that time. (We now say T tango, not T toc). \nThe house was closed when WW1 ended, but a number of men who had made use of it, especially the chapel, got together to form a charitable organisation which they called TocH. \nTocH developed greatly from that time to become an international organisation that tries to improve the lives of those who need help. \nTalbot House still exists today as a museum/hotel. (The house was named after Lieutenant Gilbert Talbot, who was the brother of Padre Neville Talbot and had been killed at Ypres in 1915, aged 23yrs.)",

It was dedicated on 23 September 2003, the anniversary of the death of the first soldier in 1969. At the beginning of the UlsterAsh Grove is a stone circle reflecting the geography and geology of Northern Ireland. There is one block of stone from each county: Londonderry, Tyrone, Armagh, Antrim, Fermanagh, Down. They are laid out to form a symbolic map of Northern Ireland and enclose a simple granite pillar with a dedication to those involved and they form a tranquil place where people can rest and remember those who lost their lives. The lives of all soldiers (British and UDR) are commemorated by ash trees, one for each soldier killed in action. The ash was chosen because of the Irish song ‘Down by the Ash Grove’. The memorial trees are dedicated by Regiment and then by date of death. The Ulster Ash Grove was dedicated on the anniversary of the death of the first soldier in 1969. The Ulster Defence Regiment became operational on 1 April 1970 to support the Regular Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary in protecting the people of Northern Ireland against sabotage and armed attack. Both men and women originally served part-time but as responsibilities increased nearly half became full-time. 193 men and 4 women were killed on operations, in their homes or workplace. Another 63 were also killed by terrorist action. The UDR merged with the Royal Irish Rangers to form the Royal Irish Regiment on 1st July 1992. In October, the Queen awarded those who had served with the Ulster Defence Regiment and Home Service Battalions of the Irish Regiment with the unique collective award of The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. There is an avenue of trees and a pavement of dedicated granite paviours remembering each of those who died. The Royal Ulster Constabulary worked to protect life and property, prevent and detect crime, and keep communities safe from 1922 to 2001. While endeavouring to keep the fabric of society together against ruthless Irish terrorists 312 officers lost their lives and over 10,000 were seriously injured. Queen Elizabeth II awarded the RUC the George Cross for their gallantry and courage in trying to keep the peace in Northern Ireland. The memorial to the RUC is the RUC George Cross Way which has granite paviours identifying each of the 38 Sub-divisional policing areas in Northern Ireland with an Irish Juniper tree planted behind each one.

Adopting the surname ‘Atkins’ (an Anglicised version of her Jewish mother’s maiden name “Etkins”), she came to Britain in the late 1930s to scape the threatening political situation in Europe and the growing extremism and antisemitism\ndeveloping in Romania. Vera was recrutied by the Special Operations Executive and given special responsibility to the women agents who were being sent into occupied France to act as couriers, radio operators and to help train the resistance forces. After the war she went back into Europe to find out what had happened to her women agents who did not return and found that 12 of them had been captured and executed in German Concentration Camps. She is remembered as a resourceful, forthright woman whose special diplomacy and negotiation skills provided much needed intelligence during the Second World War. Before her death in 2000 (age 92), Atkins was appointed CBE in the 1997 Birthday Honours. She was previously awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1948 and made a Knight of the Legion of Honour by the French government in 1995. Located in the Allied Special Forces Memorial Grove is a memorial dedicated to Vera Atkins, Intelligence Officer of \"F\" section (French) - Special Operations Executive.

Queen Victoria presented the first 62 awards in Hyde Park on 26th June 1857: 12 Navy, 2 Royal Marines and 48 Army. \nThe warrant has been amended several times. E.g.: \nIn 1902 King Edward VII approved the principle of awarding the VC posthumously. \n_On 21st October 1911 King George V admitted native officers and other ranks of the Indian Army to eligibility for the VC. \nThe warrant of 22nd May 1922 extended the scope of the award to include members of the RAF, and ‘Air Forces of our Dominions, Colonies, Dependencies or Protectorates’; and ‘Matrons, sisters, nurses and staff of the Nursing Services and other services pertaining to Hospitals and Nursing and civilians of either sex serving regularly or Temporarily under the orders, direction or supervision’ of specified Naval Military or Air Forces. \n\nThe medal, made from the bronze cascabels of cannon captured at Sebastopol, has always been manufactured by Messrs Hancocks of London. \nThe ribbon, 1½ inches wide, has been crimson since the Royal Warrant of 22nd May 1920 (originally it was crimson for the army and dark blue for the navy) and the inscription on the medal reads ‘FOR VALOUR’. When the ribbon is worn alone a miniature of the V.C. is placed at the centre of the ribbon. \nThe bar to the V.C. has been awarded on only three occasions: Captain Arthur Martin-Leake R.A.M.C.

The memorial represents one hundred years since the Association was formed and it is very fitting that installation was able to go ahead in what should have been a year of celebration when so many planned events had to be cancelled. The stone was constructed by Robyn Golden-Hann. It represents not only former wrens but also the Women of the Royal Naval Services as they are today. The WRNS were founded in l9l7 to support the men of the Royal Navy, but were disbanded in 1919. In 1939, at the outbreak of WW2, they were re-established and remained in service until 1993 when they were fully integrated into the Royal Navy. Women now carry out exactly the same duties as their male counterparts, both at sea and ashore. The garden is dedicated to all who served in the service and is designed to encourage birds, insects and butterflies. The pathways form the shape of an anchor. The wren, which was carved by the Essex Woodcarvers, forms part of a memorial for the 21 WRNS and a Naval Nursing Sister who lost their lives when their ship, SS Aguila, was torpedoed inl94l. One of the first WRNS to see active service was Wendy Clayin, who in 1990, served on board HMS Brilliant. The Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), known as the Wrens, was formed in 1917 to release Royal Navy men for sea service during the First World War. It was disbanded after the war. On 11th April 1939 Vera Laughton Matthews was appointed Director of the newly reformed Women’s Royal Naval Service WRNS: she had previously been a member during World War 1. It was originally envisaged that there would be about 3000 women in the WRNS, however at its peak the number was more than 65,000. Around 75,000 Wrens carried out highly confidential and responsible roles in Britain and overseas. The WRNS was fully integrated into the Royal Navy in 1993.\nIndex\nThis charming garden at the far end of the Royal Naval Review is dedicated to the WRNS and has been designed to encourage birds, insects and butterflies. The paths are in the shape of an anchor. Buddleia shrubs provide a haven for butterflies in summer. The two rose beds are planted with “Wren” roses to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Association of Wrens 1917 – 2007. Notcutts Nurseries developed this rose for the 2007 Chelsea Flower Show and donated plants to the Wrens Garden at the NMA. In the rose beds and against the trees may be found dedications to individual Wrens.\nLocated in the garden is the Aguila Memorial, a beautifully carved wren which commemorates the 21 WRNS and one Naval Nursing Sister who were lost when SS Aguila was torpedoed in 1941 (see M-152 Aguilla Memorial).",

They could! In short, without the Y Service, Bletchley would not have had the coded Enigma messages to decipher, and the work of these combined teams of many thousands of secret and silent heroes is now widely acknowledged as having shortened WW2 by at least two years. \nWinston Churchill called those involved his \"geese that laid the golden eggs but never cackled\". \nIn the right-hand corner is a bench in memory of the 3 Royal Navy men from the warship HMS Petard - Colin Grazier, Tony Fasson and Tommy Brown - who were instrumental in recovering code books from a sinking German submarine in 1942, which helped considerably in breaking the German Enigma code. \nUnfortunately, Colin Grazier (a native of Tamworth) and Tony Fasson drowned when the submarine sank.

From 1830 to 1858 the Bombay Marine became the Indian Navy. After the end of Company rule in 1857 the name reverted to Bombay Marine until in 1877 it was renamed Her Majesties Indian Marine. In 1892 it became the Royal Indian Marine. With the introduction of the Indian Navy (Discipline) Act 1934, the Royal Indian Navy was formally inaugurated on 2nd October 1934; its ships carried the prefix HMIS.

The Keeper of the Souls has a grand pedigree, being an original idea of HRH The Duke of York who was Colonel in Chief of the Regiment. During a visit to the stone yard in February 2009, he suggested that carvers might include a tribute to the soldiers and this idea was developed by Conservator Mason Carver; Lee Godfrey. \nThe design of The Keeper of the Souls draws on the original motifs and meaning of York Minster’s Lady Chapel. It is based upon the 14 Angels who surmount York Minster’s Great East Windows depiction of God the Father in heaven. The East Window Angel voussoirs (wedge shaped stones used in the building of arches) influence the hair, facial features and cloud formation. The wings and position of the hands are based on angels hovering in the bosses of the Lady Chapel. Finally, the altars in the Lady Chapel were used as places to pray for the acceptance of departed souls. \nThe angel holds a shield to protect the insignia and souls of the Yorkshire Regiment; the angel is also the protector to the insignia and souls of the antecedent regiment, namely: The Princes of Wales’s Own Regiment of Yorkshire, The Green Howards.
