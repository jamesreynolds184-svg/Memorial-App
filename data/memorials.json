    "description": "Arctic Convoys - Russian Convoys\n\n\n\nThis memorial of black Aberdeen granite was dedicated on 14 August 2012 in honour of all who sailed on the Arctic Convoys during\n\nthe Second World War.\n\n\n\nThe memorial’s inscription is engraved in both English and Russian.\n\n\n\nBetween June 1941 and May 1945, the United Kingdom supplied Russia with millions of tons of war-related goods. These convoys\n\nwere protected by Royal Navy ships of many types, with only 22 losses.\n\n\n\nMen serving on these ships undertook this most hazardous journey through seas littered with floes and bergs with force nine and 11\n\nwinds whipping the seas into mountainous waves. It was always cold, both inside and out, with the permanent duty of ice breaking\n\nfrom the superstructure to prevent them from capsizing and sinking.\n\n\n\nThe convoys suffered constant attack from the German Navy and Air Force from their safe ports in Norway. Winston Churchill called\n\nit “The worst journey in the world”.\n\n\n\nThis is the only major memorial at the Arboretum paid for by one family: the Coyle Family. The adjacent tree is dedicated to Michael\n\nJoseph Coyle who served on Royal Navy ships escorting the merchant vessels to Russian ports.\n\n\n\nMillions of tons of war-related goods were supplied to Russia to help in their conflict against Germany. These supplies had to be carried\n\nby sea to Archangel or Murmansk. The convoys of merchant ships had to be guarded by the Royal Navy from attack by German naval\n\nand air forces. Weather conditions were usually very poor with frequent heavy seas and sub-zero temperatures. Winston Churchill\n\ncalled it ‘The worst journey in the world.’ The laser-engraved main image shows a British warship navigating in a stormy sea. Also\n\nshown are badges of the Arctic Convoy Club and the Russian Convoy Club. Script on the memorial is engraved in both English and\n\nRussian.\n\n\n\nThe terms Russian Convoys or Murmansk Convoys could also be used for search purposes.\n\n\n\nThe Arctic convoys of WW2 sailed from the United Kingdom, Iceland, and North America to northern ports in the\n\nSoviet Union – primarily Arkhangelsk (Archangel) and Murmansk.\n\n\n\nThere were 78 convoys between August 1941 and May 1945\n\nAbout 1,400 merchant ships delivered essential supplies to the Soviet Union under the Anglo-Soviet agreement and\n\n\n\nUS Lend-Lease program, escorted by ships of the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy and U.S. Navy\n\n85 merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships (two cruisers, six destroyers, eight other escort ships) were lost. Commented [PH1]: This appears to be from Wikipedia\n\n\n\nand differs from what is quoted in the previous guidebook.\n\nIn some books the Arctic Convoys are referred to as the Russian Arctic Convoys or the Murmansk Run However, I have not been able to track down an alternative\n\n\n\nsource.\n\n\n\nThe Campaign\n\n\n\nIn response to the German invasion of the USSR on 21st June 1941 the British Government decided that help would be sent\n\nto the USSR and on 12th July Rear-Admiral Philip Vian was ordered to report to London for instructions: he was to go to\n\nMoscow, Polyarnoe and Archangel in order to make the arrangements for convoys to be received in Russia. Between 12th\n\nAugust 1941 (Operation Dervish) and 30th May 1945 (Convoy RA67) convoys carried nearly 4 million tons of supplies to the\n\nUSSR in order to aid the Russian war effort. The Convoys sailed from Liverpool, Iceland or Loch Ewe in north-west Scotland\n\nto the Russian ports of Murmansk and Archangel.\n\n\n\nThe majority of convoys took place in the winter months in order give cover of darkness: in the Arctic summer there would\n\nhave been 24 hours daylight. The weather was frequently dire with high seas, gale force winds and ice building up on the\n\nupper works of vessels making them top heavy with the potential to capsize. It should be noted that any one falling into\n\nthe Arctic Water in winter would die of cold within minutes.\n\n\n\nEach convoy had a close escort whose task was to protect the merchant vessels from U-boat and aircraft attack; in addition\n\nthere was a covering force of battleships and cruisers to provide additional protection if the Kriegsmarine’s large surface\n\nvessels made an attack.\n\n\n\nThere were three notable battles within this campaign:-\n\n\n\nThe Tragedy of Convoy PQ17 - July 1942\n\n\n\nConvoy PQ 17 suffered the worst losses of any convoy in the Second World War. The convoy had been sailing in good order\n\nand had successfully beaten off attacks from German aircraft and U-boats when intelligence reached the Admiralty that a\n\nGerman battle group headed by the battleship Tirpitz was about to sail from Altenfjord in northern Norway (Fall\n\nRösselsprung). The First Sea Lord Admiral Dudley Pound ordered the escorts to retire and the convoy to scatter. The German\n\n\n\nbattle group did not leave port until the following day, and was subsequently ordered to return to port, taking no part in\n\nthe sinking of the merchant ships.\n\n\n\nOf the 37 ships which had sailed from Iceland 2 turned back, 8 were sunk by aircraft, 9 by U-boats and 7 by U-boats after\n\nbeing damaged by aircraft. Only 11 of the 37 merchant ships in the convoy succeeded in reaching a Russian port. The lost\n\ncargo included 430 tanks, 210 crated aircraft, 3350 vehicles and 99316 tons of general cargo. The Germans lost just 5\n\naircraft.\n\n\n\nThe Battle of the Barents Sea - 31st December 1942\n\n\n\nOn the evening of 30th December 1942 a German force, commanded by Admiral Kummetz, comprising the heavy cruisers\n\nHipper and Lutzow together with six destroyers sailed from Altenfjord on Fall Regenboden/Operation Rainbow. The\n\nobjectives were to intercept and destroy Convoy JW 51B and for Lutzow to break out on a commerce raiding cruise.\n\n\n\nThe British Force, commanded by Captain St Vincent Sherbrooke, comprised the destroyers Onslow, Orwell, Obedient and\n\nObdurate from the 17th Destroyer Flotilla, the destroyer HMS Achates and the minesweeper HMS Bramble: there were\n\nfurther escorts but due to poor weather the previous day they had become detached and did not participate directly in the\n\nbattle. In addition there was a covering force (Force R- commanded by Rear Admiral Burnett) comprising the cruisers HMS\n\nJamaica and HMS Sheffield plus two destroyers. It should be noted that the German cruisers and destroyers were larger\n\nand more powerful than their British opponents.\n\n\n\nEvery time the Admiral Hipper made an attack Captain Sherbrook responded by placing his vessels between the German\n\nforce and the convoy and because they were afraid of being torpedoed the German force retired. Despite HMS Onslow\n\nbeing badly damaged and Captain Sherbrooke wounded this continued until Force R arrived.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the battle the British destroyer HMS Achates and the Minesweeper HMS Bramble were sunk together with\n\nthe German destroyer Friedrich Eckholt. The German force was forced to retire to port without damaging any of the\n\nmerchant ships and the plan for the breakout of the Lutzow for a commerce raiding cruise was abandoned.\n\n\n\nThe aftermath of the battle was that Captain Sherbrooke was awarded an immediate VC and the head of the German Navy,\n\nGrand Admiral Raeder, resigned after being harangued by Hitler for over an hour.\n\n\n\nThe Battle of North Cape - 26th December 1943\n\n\n\nOn 20th December 1943 the 19 merchant vessels of Convoy JW 55B set sail from Loch Ewe and by Christmas day were\n\nsouth of Bear Island. The German High Command decided to send out the battlecruiser Scharnhorst accompanied by five\n\ndestroyers to destroy the convoy: the battle group commanded by Rear Admiral Erich Bey departed Altenfjord at 17:00 on\n\nChristmas Day.\n\n\n\nUnknown to the Germans Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser (C in C Home Fleet) had placed two covering forces in the area. In the\n\nmorning of 26th December Scharnhorst encountered the British cruisers (Belfast, Norfolk and Sheffield), commanded by\n\nVice-Admiral R L Burnett, and had its forward radar destroyed. Scharnhorst one again tried to attack the convoy but ran\n\ninto the cruisers. The Scharnhorst headed south pursued by the cruisers. Meanwhile Admiral Fraser in the battleship HMS\n\nDuke of York accompanied by HMS Jamaica and her escorts were racing to intercept. At 16:45 the Duke of York illuminated\n\nthe Scharnhorst by star shell and the final battle began. After the Scharnhorst had been pounded by the battleship and\n\ncruisers and torpedoed by the destroyers she sank at about 19:45. Only 36 members of her crew were rescued from the\n\nicy sea.\n\n\n\nAdmiral Fraser told his officers, ”I hope that if any of you are ever called upon to lead a ship into action against an opponent\n\nmany times superior, you will command your ship as gallantly as Scharnhorst was commanded today”.\n\n\n\nThis was the last time a British Battleship engaged in a battle with another capital ship.\n\n\n\nThe Tirpitz\n\n\n\nThe German battleship Tirpitz (42,900tons standard) with eight 380mm (15inch) guns was stationed throughout its career\n\nin the Norwegian Fiords and was a threat to the convoys: this meant that each convoy had to have a powerful covering\n\nforce. There were many attempts to eliminate this threat.\n\n\n\nOperation Source: September 1942 - the attack by midget submarines X5, X6 & X7 which damaged Tirpitz putting her under\n\nrepair until April 1944. Lt Donald Cameron (X6) and Lt Basil Place (X7) were awarded the VC.\n\n\n\nOperation Tungsten: April 1944 – An attack by aircraft from HMS Victorious and HMS Furious escorted by two battleships\n\nand five cruisers. Tirpitz was again damaged and put out of action until June.\n\n\n\nOperation Goodwood: 29th August 1944 – There were four attacks from aircraft carriers that caused minor damage.\n\n\n\nOperation Paravane: 15th September 1944 – 23 Lancaster bombers equipped with Tallboy bombs attacked the Tirpitz. One\n\nbomb went through the forward part of the ship causing extensive damage. (The Tallboy was a 12,000 lb bomb designed\n\nby Barnes Wallace)\n\n\n\nOperation Obviate: 29th October 1944 – 32 Lancaster bombers (9 & 617 Squadrons) caused further damage.\n\n\n\nOperation Catechism: 12th November 1944 – 32 Lancaster bombers (9 & 617 Squadrons) dropped 29 Tallboy bombs and\n\nachieved 2 direct hits and a near miss; this caused the Tirpitz to turn over.\n\n\n\nWith the elimination of Tirpitz heavy units of the Royal Navy could be moved to the Pacific.\n\n\n\nConvoy Data\n\n\n\nPrior to the disaster of Convoy PQ17 in July 1942 the outbound convoys were prefixed PQ and the return convoys QP. After\n\nPQ17 the outbound were prefixed JW and the return convoys RA. The total convoys for each year are shown in the following\n\ntable. The number of merchant vessels in each convoy varied significantly.\n\n\n\nConvoys per Year\n\n\n\nYear 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 Total\n\n\n\nOutbound 9 12 6 10 4 41\n\n\n\nReturn 4 12 6 10 4 36\n\n\n\nAllied Losses\n\n\n\nCruisers 2 HMS Edinburgh & HMS Trinidad\n\n\n\nDestroyers 7 HMS Achates, HMS Hardy, HMS Mahratta, HMS Matabele,\n\n\n\nHMS Punjabi & HMS Somali plus the Russian Sokrushitelny\n\n\n\nSloops 3 HMS Kite, HMS Lark & HMS Lapwing.\n\n\n\nFrigate 1 HMS Goodall\n\n\n\nCorvettes 3 HMS Bluebell, HMS Denbigh Castle, & HNoMS Tunsberg Castle\n\n\n\nMinesweepers 4 HMS Bramble, HMS Gossamer, HMS Leda & HMS Niger.\n\n\n\nSubmarines 1 Jastrzab (Polish)\n\n\n\nArmed Whaler 1 Shera\n\n\n\nMerchant Ships 104\n\n\n\nGerman Losses\n\n\n\nBattle Cruiser 1 Scharnhorst\n\n\n\nDestroyers 2 Friedrich Eckholdt & Z26\n\n\n\nAuxiliary Vessels 2 Bremse & Ulm\n\n\n\nU Boats 31\n\n\n\nThe Arctic Star\n\n\n\nParticipation in the Arctic Convoys was one of the WW2 Campaigns that had not entitled participants to a specific campaign\n\nmedal. After many years of campaigning it was announced in late 2012 that members of the armed services and merchant\n\nseamen who had participated in the Arctic convoys would be entitled to the Arctic Star. The first Arctic star medal was\n\npresented to approximately 40 veterans on 19th March 2013.\n\n\n\nThe Memorial and the Coyle Family\n\n\n\nMichael Coyle served in the Royal Navy during WW2, part of that service being on the Arctic Convoys. When he died his\n\nfamily decided that the money that he left should go to the erection of a memorial to remember those who had served on\n\nthe Arctic Convoys.\n\n\n\nThe picture below shows his daughter on the occasion of the dedication of the memorial on 14th August 2012. The lower\n\nleft picture is the inscription on the side of the memorial and the plaque to Michael Coyle is by the tree next to the memorial.\n\n\n\nROYAL FLEET AUXILLARY (RFA)\n\n\n\nFirst established in 1905 to provide coaling ships to fill the bunkers of RN vessels\n\nPart of the Royal Navy but crewed mostly by civilians and Royal Naval Reserve.\n\nPrimary role is to offer logistical support to Royal Navy ships at sea, by delivering essential equipment/ supplies/\n\n\n\nfuel/ mail.\n\nThe RFA has also been deployed to provide humanitarian aid to disaster areas around the globe.\n\nThe RFA has also been used to transport members of the Royal Marines and British Army.\n\nTwo RFA vessels were lost in the Falklands conflict - Sir Tristram and Sir Galahad.\n\nThe Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA)\n\nThe Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) is a civilian-manned fleet of vessels owned by the United Kingdom, and provides support for\n\n\n\nvarious functions of the Royal Navy, such as resupplying fuel and ammunition to Navy ships while at sea. Ships in its service\n\ncarry the prefix “RFA”.\n\n\n\nIt was established in 1905, and has assisted the Royal Navy in many different conflicts across the globe, symbolised by the\n\ngrey granite paving stones, set in the shape of a compass.\n\n\n\nThe triangular plinth of polished granite represents the bow of an RFA ship, and is surrounded by different coloured stones\n\nforming the shape of the ship's bow wave.\n\n\n\nThe memorial was dedicated in the presence of the RFA Commodore-in-Chief, His Royal Highness The Earl of Wessex, KG\n\nGCVO ADC on 11 October 2012.\n\n\n\nSince 1905 the civilian-manned Royal Fleet Auxiliary has delivered worldwide logistical and operational support for a wide\n\nrange of tasks undertaken by the Royal Navy, its sailors and marines. The base of the memorial is a circular pavement of\n\ndifferent types of grey granite in the form of a compass, symbolising how the RFA has supported the Navy around the world.\n\nOn this base is a triangular plinth of grey polished granite representing the bow of a ship with the name of ROYAL FLEET\n\nAUXILIARY. On the back of this plinth is etched an image of a ship of the RFA fleet from a photograph by John Crae. The\n\npavement around the plinth uses different coloured granite to symbolise the waves formed by the ship running through\n\nwater. At the rear of the circular pavement are two dark grey angled headstones with the badge of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary\n\nand a list of the 24 ships of the RFA that have suffered fatalities during conflict: RFA Thrush (1917), RFA Creosol(1918), RFA\n\nVitol(1918), RFA Hungerford (1918), RFA Industry (1918), RFA Hughli (1919), RFA Cairndale (1941), RFA Maine (1941), RFA\n\nPetrella (1941), RFA Darkdale (1941), RFA Ebonol (1941), RFA Francol (1942), RFA Slavol (1942), RFA Montenol (1942), RFA\n\nDinsdale (1942), RFA Brambleleaf (1942), RFA Gray Ranger (1942), RFA Ennerdale (1943), RFA Broomdale (1944), RFA War\n\nNizam (1944), RFA Bishopdale (1944), RFA War Diwan (1944), RFA Sir Galahad (1982), RFA Sir Tristram (1982).",

Lancastria was\n\ncarrying both service personnel and civilians; it is unknown how many were on board at the time but some estimates\n\nare up 9,000. This was such a catastrophe that that Churchill ordered a “D Notice” - a total news blackout - for fear\n\nof the damage this may do to the country's morale.\n\n\n\nIn WW2 many ocean-going pleasure liners were requisitioned by the British Government to support the war\n\neffort.\n\n\n\nHMT Lancastria's capacity was 1,300 passengers, it was deployed to St Nazaire, France, to assist in the evacuation\n\nof British Nationals and troops from France, two weeks after Dunkirk.\n\n\n\nOn the 17 June 1940 it was agreed to load 3,000 onto the ship but that number increased during the boarding,\n\nestimated between 5,000 and 9,000.\n\n\n\nThe Captain of Lancastria could have left port around 14:00 but the RN destroyer which was to escort it had been\n\nbombed by the Germans.\n\n\n\nSo Lancastria's Captain decided to wait for an escort\n\nUnfortunately, while waiting, a fresh air raid began at around 16:00 and Lancastria was hit by three or possibly\n\n\n\nfour bombs.\n\nA number of survivors reported that one of the bombs had gone down the ships only funnel causing the ship to\n\n\n\nsink quickly - around 15-20 minutes.\n\nOpinions differ on actual loss of life but the general consensus is at least 3,000, up to around 7,000.\n\nA simple stone memorial is located in front of the ‘Lancastria Oak’ within the Merchant Navy Woodland, bearing a circular\n\n\n\nplaque inscribed with the Lancastria Association badge and emblem.\n\nThe story of the Lancastria is little known but represents the biggest disaster in British maritime history.\n\nOn 17 June 1940, the 16,000-ton Cunard liner Lancastria lay five miles off St Nazaire embarking troops, RAF personnel and\n\n\n\ncivilian refugees, including women and children, who were being evacuated from France, which was then on the point of\n\ncollapse. The exact number of people on board may never be known, but almost certainly exceeded 6,000; some estimates\n\nwere as high as 9,000.\n\n\n\nThe Lancastria was attacked and hit by bombs from German aircraft. The ship sank rapidly and, according to the estimate of\n\nthe Commanding Officer, Captain Rudolf Sharpe, only around 2,500 of those on board were saved.\n\n\n\nDue to the scale of the tragedy and in the interests of public morale (this also being the day that the French government\n\ndecided to seek an armistice with Nazi Germany), Winston Churchill forbade publication of the news at the time, hence the\n\nstory of the Lancastria has never been generally known, although it is Britain’s worst maritime disaster.\n\n\n\nSince the Second World War, the Lancastria Association and Lancastria Association of Scotland have established memorials to\n\nthe victims and carry out remembrance services every year.",

Awarded the Wilkinson Sword of Peace\n\nIn 2020 with the 40th anniversary of the Falklands Conflict rapidly approaching the HMS SHEFFIELD Association agreed that a\n\n\n\nmemorial should be placed at the National Memorial Arboretum to honour all those who served in the three ships of that\n\nname and that there should also be a place of remembrance for the 20 men lost when the second vessel of the name was\n\ndamaged in action on the 4th of May 1982. In the spring of 2021, the artist Peter Naylor was commissioned to design a\n\nmemorial which reflected all three ships and their close association with the city of Sheffield and its industries. The City of\n\nSheffield Master Cutler was approached for assistance in making the memorial. The fabrication of the memorial was led by\n\nWilliam Cook steel casting and supported by Tinsley Bridge, Outokumpu, and Charles Day Steels. The Association are\n\nextremely proud that their memorial was made of stainless steel by skilled craftsmen in the city of Sheffield. The memorial\n\nconsists of a stainless-steel bow of a warship set in a stainless steel base, within in the deconstructed cruiser’s crest.

Mrs\n\nSalt consecrated the memorial on the 4th of May 2022 with a bottle of sea water collected in the South Atlantic by HMS\n\nForth.\n\n\n\nSymbolism\n\nPositioned close to the South Atlantic Memorial and the corner of the Naval Field the memorial links the South Atlantic\n\n\n\nconflict with the large part played in that conflict by the Royal Navy and supporting Maritime services.\n\nThe design of the memorial and its manufacture in stainless steel proudly links all three ships with the City of Sheffield and its\n\n\n\nworld-famous steel industries. When they were constructed all three warships were presented with ship’s bells and fittings of\n\nstainless steel made in Sheffield.\n\n\n\nThe memorial represents a warship at speed as it cuts through a dull grey sea during operations. The sea is set in the\n\ndeconstructed pentagonal crest of the cruiser which links the second world war generation of sailors to the modern era.\n\n\n\nThe warship crest on the top of the memorial takes the sheaf of arrows from the city of Sheffield Coat of Arms.

It was eventually tracked down and engaged by three ships from the Royal Navy’s South American division (the\n\ncruisers HMS Ajax, HMS Exeter, and HMS Achilles) commanded by Commodore Henry Harwood Harwood. All four ships sustained\n\nconsiderable damage and Graf Spee limped into an estuary in neutral Uruguay to undertake necessary repairs.\n\n\n\nGiven just 72 hours to repair, the Germans knew escape was impossible and scuttled (sank) the ship in the River Plate. Two days later,\n\nin Buenos Aires where the crew were taken, Kapitän Langsdorff committed suicide. He was buried there with full military honours and\n\nthe service was attended by British officers who were present in the city.\n\n\n\nThis impressive black granite memorial was unveiled in the presence of the few remaining River Plate veterans on 12 April 2014 to\n\nmark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the River Plate.\n\n\n\nSignificantly, it was the 300th memorial to be dedicated at the Arboretum.\n\n\n\nThe Graf Spee was a German battleship; her mission, to destroy allied merchant ships in the Atlantic.\n\nIn December 1940 she was engaged by HM Ships Exeter, Ajax and Achilles\n\nExeter was badly damaged and withdrew; the other two ships, although damaged, remained on station.\n\nThe Graf Spee put into Montevideo, Uruguay, which was a neutral country, so she could only stay for 24 hours for\n\n\n\nhumanitarian reasons; however, she managed to stay for 72 hours.\n\nThe Admiralty sent a signal to Ajax and Achilles informing them that a carrier and a battlecruiser were on their way\n\n\n\nas support; this was in fact one of the greatest deceptions of the war, they were not.\n\nGraf Spee's captain, convinced that stronger forces were waiting, left the majority of his crew behind and sailed out\n\n\n\nof the port where he scuttled his ship; he committed suicide two days later.\n\nMost of his crew stayed in Montevideo, others went to Buenos Aires, many of them married and raised families; the\n\n\n\nlast surviving crew member, died in Buenos Aires June 2007 aged 89.\n\nThe apron approaching the memorial shows the exact size of the shells that were exchanged.\n\nThe front of the memorial shows the crests and silhouettes of the 3 RN ships, the reverse side is the ship's crest and\n\n\n\nsilhouette of the Graf Spee.\n\nThere are two quotes from Winston Churchill; \"This brilliant sea fight takes its place in our naval annals and in long\n\n\n\ncold dark winter it warms the cockles of the British hearts\"; and other one says, \"This great battle will long be told\n\nin song and story\"\n\n\n\nBehind the memorial is a small pavier with the inscription, \"sealed herein are the names of those who served on\n\nHMS Ajax, HMS Achilles, HMS Exeter and Admiral Graf Spee who gave their lives whilst serving their country.

It represents not only former wrens but also the Women of the Royal Naval Services\n\nas they are today.\n\n\n\nThe WRNS were founded in l9l7 to support the men of the Royal Navy, but were disbanded in 1919.\n\nIn 1939, at the outbreak of WW2, they were re-established and remained in service until 1993 when they were fully\n\n\n\nintegrated into the Royal Navy. Women now carry out exactly the same duties as their male counterparts, both at\n\nsea and ashore.\n\n\n\nThe garden is dedicated to all who served in the service and is designed to encourage birds, insects and butterflies.\n\nThe pathways form the shape of an anchor.\n\n\n\nThe wren, which was carved by the Essex Woodcarvers, forms part of a memorial for the 21 WRNS and a Naval\n\nNursing Sister who lost their lives when their ship, SS Aguila, was torpedoed inl94l.\n\n\n\nOne of the first WRNS to see active service was Wendy Clayin, who in 1990, served on board HMS Brilliant.\n\nThe Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), known as the Wrens, was formed in 1917 to release Royal Navy men for sea\n\n\n\nservice during the First World War. It was disbanded after the war.\n\nOn 11th April 1939 Vera Laughton Matthews was appointed Director of the newly reformed Women’s Royal Naval\n\n\n\nService WRNS: she had previously been a member during World War 1. It was originally envisaged that there would be about\n\n3000 women in the WRNS, however at its peak the number was more than 65,000. Around 75,000 Wrens carried out highly\n\nconfidential and responsible roles in Britain and overseas. The WRNS was fully integrated into the Royal Navy in 1993.\n\n\n\nThis charming garden at the far end of the Royal Naval Review is dedicated to the WRNS and has been designed to encourage\n\nbirds, insects and butterflies. The paths are in the shape of an anchor. Buddleia shrubs provide a haven for butterflies in\n\nsummer. The two rose beds are planted with “Wren” roses to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Association of Wrens\n\n1917 – 2007. Notcutts Nurseries developed this rose for the 2007 Chelsea Flower Show and donated plants to the Wrens\n\nGarden at the NMA. In the rose beds and against the trees may be found dedications to individual Wrens.\n\n\n\nLocated in the garden is the Aguila Memorial, a beautifully carved wren which commemorates the 21 WRNS and one Naval\n\nNursing Sister who were lost when SS Aguila was torpedoed in 1941 (see M-152 Aguilla Memorial).",

In 1940 she was requisitioned and commissioned into the Royal Navy at Singapore.\n\n\n\nShortly before the British surrender, Li Wo was ordered to head for the safety of Batavia in the Dutch East Indies.\n\nHer crew consisted of 84 men, mostly naval reservists, but also several survivors from the Prince of Wales and\n\nRepulse, five men from the Army, two from the RAF, ten Malayans, and six Chinese.\n\n\n\nShe left Singapore at dawn on 13 February 1942, and was attacked several times from the air, suffering some\n\ndamage. The next day, while passing north of the Bangka Strait, she encountered a convoy of Japanese transport\n\nships accompanied by a squadron of warships launching \"Operation L\", the invasion of Sumatra. The commander of\n\nLi Wo, Temporary Lieutenant Thomas Wilkinson RNR, informed the ship's company that he intended to close and\n\nattack the enemy.\n\n\n\nLi Wo altered course towards the leading transport ship of the convoy at full speed, unfurling her battle ensign, and\n\nopening fire with her four-inch gun. She scored a number of direct hits on the transport, starting fires aboard, and\n\ncausing the troops aboard to abandon ship. She then attacked another transport ship with machine gun fire.\n\n\n\nLi Wo was then heavily shelled by a Japanese light cruiser and 2 Destroyers. Out of ammunition and now sinking,\n\nshe rammed the first enemy transport, which later sank, before finally sinking herself. Of the 84 crew, only 7 survived\n\nto be taken prisoner.

    "description": "The Submariner Memorial\n\n\n\nIn 1921 the sum of £2130 was raised by public subscription to create a “Memorial tablet to the Officers and Men of the Submarine\n\nService R.N.” on the Embankment. It was dedicated in June 1922 and remains a very important place in the hearts and minds of all\n\nsubmariners. Yet the Embankment is not the most peaceful nor easiest place to meet for collective or private acts of remembrance or\n\nfor quiet reflection. Moreover, the Embankment Memorial recognises submarines lost in the two world wars but not the submariners\n\nlost since then.\n\n\n\nIn the years since its opening the National Memorial Arboretum has grown into the centre of national remembrance and all armed\n\nand public services and many of their units and branches have placed memorials on this site. Indeed, the Submariners Associat ion\n\nplaced a small plaque here to submarines lost in the wars and another to our VC winners when the Arboretum opened.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, however, there has been a growing call for a more fitting memorial for the nearly 6000 submariners who have given\n\ntheir lives in service and, for the first time, to have a memorial which recognises the sacrifice of their families. This was acknowledged\n\nin July 2019 when a group of retired submariners came together to form a charity - The Submariner Memorial Appeal.\n\n\n\nThe aim was not only to raise funds, plan and install a new memorial, but in the process to bring the disparate elements of the\n\nsubmarine community together. The appeal was launched by the then Second Sea Lord in front of HMS ANSON in Devonshire Dock\n\nHall at BAES Barrow-in-Furness on 28 February 2020 and a public competition to find ideas to inspire a professional designer\n\nannounced.\n\n\n\nFrom over 600 entries, three age category winners and one overall winner were chosen and their designs given to three carefully\n\nselected professional sculptors. The sculptors were given wide latitude to be inspired by the winning entries but not to have to\n\nreproduce them. The resulting designs were all very different but all impressive, however, Paul Day’s entry immediately engaged the\n\nBoard’s emotions and caught the spirit of the submarine service.\n\n\n\nWhilst Paul progressed the detailed design and casting of the memorial, fundraising ramped up. Around £500,000 would be needed.\n\nThe appeal was very lucky to receive two particularly significant donations from the Gosling Foundation and from an anonymous\n\ndonor. Submarine Industries were also very generous with 21 separate companies contributing. Livery companies, the Freemasons,\n\nthe Royal Naval Royal Marine Charity, the RN Association and our submarine charities all supported the appeal and many individual\n\ncontributions were made through crowd funding and a wealth of individual fundraising activities. These included running, rowing,\n\ncycling, painting, drawing, printing, coining (selling commemorative coins), writing, merchandising and more. The standout individual\n\neffort was Mr Graham Bishop who completed the London Marathon dressed as a model of a submarine.The money was raised in time\n\nfor the turf to be cut by Diana Mayes, 100yr old widow of Lt Gordon Noll, CO of HMS UNTAMED and a young submariner from HMS\n\nVIGILANT on 6 September 2021.\n\n\n\nThe memorial itself is 3500kg of bronze sculpted into a divided fin of a submarine with the lone figure of a submariner standing\n\nbetween the two halves looking to the surface. On one outer side of the fin is a frieze of families waiting for the return of their loved\n\nones and on the other fin the Churchill quote:\n\n\n\n“Of all the branches of men in the forces there is none which shows more devotion and faces grimmer perils than the submariners.”\n\n\n\nThe memorial is on a long low mound to give the idea that the rest of the boat is just below the water. An interpretation board is sited\n\nby its ‘port bow’. On this is a QR code which links to a new Online Book of Remembrance gifted to the Appeal by the Friends of the\n\nRN Submarine Museum.\n\n\n\nThis is a very significant piece of work in it is own right, it features the most detailed and well researched list of those who gave their\n\nlives in service in submarines. It will allow people to add stories and photographs of those whom they have lost and the QR code will\n\nbe shared with all the other submarine memorials (over 60) around the country. Funds have been set aside to add it to the\n\nEmbankment Memorial as well.\n\n\n\nThe Submarine Service was formed in 1901 when 6 officers and a number of ratings started submarine training.\n\nThat same year the British Government placed an order for 5 American Holland class submarines to be built under\n\nlicence by Vickers Sons and Maxim Ltd at Barrow-in-Furness. HMS Holland 1 launched in January 1902.\n\n\n\nAlthough some senior personnel within the Admiralty saw little point in submarines, Britain pursued an energetic\n\nsubmarine programme and by 1910 had 61 operational submarines.\n\n\n\nSubmarines played a major role in both world Wars and a total of 14 VCs were awarded to submariners.\n\nFrom the start of the submarine programme, a total of 174 submarines have been lost - the majority during the two\n\n\n\nWorld Wars. The last submarine to sink was in 1971 when HMS Artemis sank alongside the jetty at HMS Dolphin\n\nduring refuelling.\n\n\n\nUntil the 1950s, submarines were propelled by conventional means, a diesel engine driving a generator and, in some\n\ncases, propelling the submarine on the surface and an electric motor drawing power from a battery to propel the\n\nsubmarine when dived.\n\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the US developed submarine nuclear propulsion and in 1958, with Cold War tensions increasing,\n\nagreed to transfer the technology and one nuclear propulsion plant complete with its nuclear fuel to the UK. The\n\nnuclear propulsion plant was installed in the UK’s first nuclear submarine, HMS Dreadnought.\n\n\n\nIn 1994 the decision was taken by the government that the UK submarine force would become all nuclear.\n\nCurrently the UK operates 2 main classes of submarine, the Vanguard and Astute.The UK’s Vanguard class of\n\n\n\nsubmarine currently provides the strategic nuclear deterrent force, armed with Trident nuclear missiles and will be\n\nreplaced by new Dreadnought class submarines.",

In 1911 the Royal Navy\n\ngraduated its first aeroplane pilots at the Royal Aero Club flying ground at RAF Eastchurch.\n\n\n\nIn 1912, naval and army aviation were combined to become the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The Naval Wing of the RFC\n\nlasted until July 1914 when the Royal Navy reformed its air branch, under the Air Department of the Admiralty,\n\nnaming it the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS).\n\n\n\nBy the outbreak of the First World War, in August 1914, the RNAS had more aircraft under its control than the\n\nremaining RFC. The roles of the RNAS were fleet reconnaissance, patrolling coasts for enemy ships and submarines\n\nand attacking enemy coastal territory.\n\n\n\nIn April 1918 the RNAS, which at this time had 67,000 officers and men, 2,949 aircraft, 103 airships and 126 coastal\n\nstations, merged with the RFC to form the Royal Air Force.\n\n\n\nIn 1924, the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force was formed, encompassing those RAF units that normally embarked\n\non aircraft carriers and fighting ships. The year was significant for British naval aviation as only weeks before the\n\nfounding of the Fleet Air Arm, the Royal Navy had commissioned HMS Hermes, the world's first ship to be designed\n\nand built as an aircraft carrier.\n\n\n\nIn 2009 the Royal Navy celebrated the centenary of Naval Aviation, and the memorial honours the sacrifice made by 6,749\n\nmen and women who gave their lives in the service of naval aviation over those 100 years.\n\n\n\nOver 80% of front-line Fleet Air Arm Squadrons are currently deployed on operations round the world.\n\nThe memorial is a sculptured plinth of Portland Stone supporting a granite aircraft carrier.

British prisoners of war captured at the fall of Hong Kong were being transported\n\nto Japan to work as slaves. After their ship was torpedoed the Japanese rescued their own troops but locked the POWs in\n\nthe holds leaving them to drown, and shot at those who managed to break out.\n\n\n\nIn 1942 the Japanese began sending POWs from their captured territories to Japan to work as slave labour in various\n\nindustries so as to free up the workforce to be enlisted into the armed forces. The second shipment of POWs from Hong\n\nKong was on the Lisbon Maru.\n\n\n\nOn 27 September 1942 the Lisbon Maru, a Japanese armed freighter with Japanese troops on board, sailed from Hong\n\nKong bound for Japan. It also carried 1,816 British prisoners of war held in atrocious conditions. Cramped, airless, and in\n\nunimaginable squalor they were incarcerated below deck in three cargo holds. The freighter bore no markings to indicate\n\ntheir presence.\n\n\n\nOn 1 October an American submarine, the USS Grouper, on patrol off the Zhoushan archipelago in the East China Sea,\n\nengaged the Lisbon Maru holing it below the waterline with a torpedo. Although initially taken under tow, the line snapped\n\nand the ship drifted and foundered. The Japanese evacuated their troops, battened down the hatches over the holds and\n\nleft a guard force to prevent the prisoners from escaping. For 24 hours the prisoners were held in sub-human conditions in\n\ndarkness with no food, water, fresh air or sanitation; and dysentery was rife.\n\n\n\nThere was a breakout before the ship sank the next day and many of the prisoners of war escaped from the two forward\n\nholds, some of whom were cut down by machine-gun fire. Most of those in the third hold, by then below the waterline,\n\ntragically drowned.\n\n\n\nThose who did escape were shot at in the water as they attempted to swim to the shore; many were killed or wounded but\n\nlocal Chinese fishermen courageously rescued 384 of the survivors. Later, the Japanese recaptured all but three.\n\n\n\nOf the original 1,816 men on board 828 died in this terrible atrocity and a further 200 or more succumbed from their sufferings\n\nwithin a few months.",

In 1952, the graves were moved to Kranji War Memorial Cemetery and the Lych Gate to the\n\nBritish Garrison Church, St George’s, in Singapore.\n\n\n\nWhen British troops withdrew completely from Singapore in 1971, the Lych Gate was dismantled and brought back to\n\nEngland where it was erected at the Queen’s Division Depot, Bassingbourn Barracks in Royston, Hertfordshire.\n\n\n\nIn 2003, the refurbished Lych Gate was reconstructed at the Arboretum by the 39th Engineering Regiment and the re dedication took place on 8 February 2004.\n\n\n\nIn the structure of the Lych Gate was carved the national emblems of the British Isles.

The Lych Gate is set in an area heavy with symbolism. It is the entrance now\n\nto the Far East Prisoners of War Grove. Most of the trees here are dedicated to individual FEPOWs, with some mentioning\n\ngroups, such as the civilian and military women and children who perished and all the FEPOWs lost at sea while being\n\ntransported.",

The idea for the caterpillar tracks came from British agriculture.\n\n\n\nBecause of the stalemate in WW1 where both sides were dug into trenches and unable to advance more than a few yards at a time,\n\nit was thought that the tank would break the stalemate. Because of its design, it could travel and crush the barbed wire fences, drive\n\nacross the trenches and could turn the guns onto the enemy.\n\n\n\nThe tank when being moved around the country for trials was packed in large wooden cases and as a security measure it was marked\n\n\"water tank\". The name on the drawing board was originally \"land ship\" but when it came to be named, they decided to drop the\n\nwater and call it a tank, on the premise that you put things in a tank i.e. men and munitions. (there are other versions of how this came\n\nabout).\n\n\n\nOn the plinth is a scale model of a Mark 5 tank from WWI, of which there were 2 main types - the ‘female’ tank armed with machine\n\nguns and the ‘male’ armed with cannons. There were a few ‘hermaphrodites’, armed with both.\n\n\n\nThe trees on the plot are largely of Ash to correspond with the Ash ‘swagger sticks’ of the officers. These came about after an officer\n\ncut a branch from an ash tree to measure the depth of mud before sending his tanks into it, a clever idea which became general\n\npractice.\n\n\n\nThe oak tree, surrounded by the seat, was grown from an acorn collected from Delville Wood, on the Somme battlefield, where the\n\ntanks were used in larger numbers. Other trees are from the Cambrai battlefield, Flesquieres and Bourlon Wood, where the Battle of\n\nCambrai took place in November 1917.\n\n\n\nAt the sides of the plot in spring, daffodils flower in the pattern of a tank’s caterpillar tracks.\n\n\n\nThe flag of the Tank Regiment is 3 horizontal stripes, from the bottom upwards, brown to red to green. Stands for, “from the mud\n\nthrough the blood to the green fields beyond”. The Moto of the RTD is “Fear Naught”\n\n\n\n4 Members of the RTG have been awarded the VC, one being awarded to 2nd Lieutenant Clement Robertson who walked in front of\n\nhis tanks to mark the way over heavily ploughed fields so as they not lose their way.\n\n\n\nThe first successful tank battle took place at Cambrai in 1917 with about 300 Mark IV tanks. Horrendous conditions inside\n\nthe tank, temperature of up to 45 degrees, crew of 8, noise from shells, engine and tracks. 3-4 mph over shell craters, the Deleted: 4 or 5\n\nsmell. They needed a strong stomach. The tank on the plinth is a Mark V (male).\n\n\n\nIn the centre of the circular seat is an oak tree, the acorn was brought back from Delville Wood. Ash trees are significant\n\nas the Officers would walk in front of the tanks with sticks made of ash, they prodded the ground to see how firm it was as\n\ntanks used to get bogged down. Officers of the Regiment carry ‘swagger’, sticks.\n\n\n\nIn the early 2000s 2 coach loads of recruits were brought to the Grove. They planted daffodil bulbs in straight lines to\n\nresemble the tank tracks.\n\n\n\nTheir flag is brown, red and green, ‘through mud and blood to pastures new’.\n\n\n\nIn WW2 37% of tank casualties were reported to be soldiers leaving the tank to brew up. Since 1945 all tanks have been\n\nfitted with a boiling vessel to make tea.\n\n\n\nIn WW2, tanks played a major part in the war - there were 46 variants, tanks of all shapes and sizes. There were:\n\n\n\no Tankettes, about the size of a large car, mainly used for reconnaissance.\n\n\n\no Medium size tanks, but not very successful, under gunned and armoured.\n\n\n\no Light tanks, used mainly for training\n\n\n\no Cruiser tanks, used mainly against enemy tanks\n\n\n\no Infantry tanks, designed and heavily armoured, used to give close support to infantry unit. The most popular of these tanks appears\n\nto be the Churchill tank of which around 5,600 were manufactured.",

The lamp itself is\n\n\n\na low-burning oil lamp that was used in the Chapel at the top of the house.\n\n\n\nThe town of Poperinge, known as Pops, became very popular with British troops. Being so close to the front line, lots of officers'\n\n\n\nbars sprang up and bars for other ranks. Brothels also appeared. Talbot House was an alternative place for soldiers who wanted\n\n\n\na quiet refuge.\n\n\n\nTalbot House was set up in 1915 by a jovial clergyman, the Rev. ‘Tubby’ Clayton providing basic comforts and a chapel for young\n\n\n\nmen going to and from the Western Front. It was a ‘home from home’ where rank had no place.\n\n\n\nThe name ‘Talbot House’ was shortened to Toc H by use of the phonetic alphabet of that time. (We now say T tango, not T toc).\n\n\n\nThe house was closed when WW1 ended, but a number of men who had made use of it, especially the chapel, got together to\n\n\n\nform a charitable organisation which they called TocH.\n\n\n\nTocH developed greatly from that time to become an international organisation that tries to improve the lives of those who\n\n\n\nneed help.\n\n\n\nTalbot House still exists today as a museum/hotel.

The Corps’ motto is ‘Ex Dentibus\n\nEnsis’, which means ‘from the teeth a sword’. This is taken from the legend of Cadmus who, in Greek mythology, slew a\n\ndragon that had killed his companions. On instructions from Athena, he sowed the dragon’s teeth in the ground and a race of\n\nfierce men sprang up called Sparti. The RADC provides dental services to members of the British Army.

The engravings\n\ndepict the work of the Corps with horses and dogs, from WW1 up to the present day.\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that the first veterinary surgeon joined in 1796, when their primary aim was to ensure that animals were\n\nproperly cared for, so maximizing their fitness for duty. That founding principle still applies today.\n\n\n\nNote the three red plaques behind, honouring three members of the RAVC killed in action during recent times:\n\n\n\no Corporal Bryan CRIDDLE killed in 1973 by a remotely detonated ‘milk churn’ bomb in Northern Ireland. His dog, Jason, was blown 30\n\nyards away by the explosion, but survived and attended his handler’s funeral at Blockley, nr Chipping Campden\n\n\n\no Lance Corporal Ken ROWE killed with his sniffer dog Sasha, during a Taliban ambush in Afghanistan in July 2008\n\n\n\no Lance Corporal Liam TASKER killed by small arms fire in March 2011 in Afghanistan. His dog Theo suffered a seizure and died on\n\nreturning to Camp Bastion. Theo was awarded a posthumous Dickin Medal\n\n\n\nOther famous animal winners of the Dickin Medal were:\n\n\n\nGustave (Pigeon) - Brought the first Commercial news of the D-Day to the UK\n\n\n\nPaddy (Pigeon) – Quickest time to bring news from Normandy back to UK\n\n\n\nDuke of Normandy (Pigeon) -,Brought news of the capture of a gun battery at Merville by Paras of the 21st Army Group\n\n\n\nBing (Dog) - Bing was trained to locate the enemy and protect military personnel,\n\n\n\nThe Royal Army Veterinary Corps is responsible for the provision, training and care of animals and is part of the British\n\nArmy.\n\n\n\nThe Army Veterinary Service was established by public demand in 1796 to address the welfare of army horses. It became\n\nthe Army Veterinary Corps in 1903 and the Royal Army Veterinary Corps in 1918. In 1942 it amalgamated with the Remount\n\nService and from 1946 became responsible for managing the Army’s dog resources.\n\n\n\nThe memorial commemorates the service and sacrifice of officers and soldiers of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and its\n\nhistorical predecessors.\n\n\n\nIt was unveiled by HRH The Princess Royal (The Honorary Colonel-in-Chief) on 2 May 2016.\n\n\n\nThe memorial incorporates the badges of the Corps before and after 1919 and has two engravings showing the Corps work\n\nwith horses and dogs. The base on which the 3 one metre high black granite panels stand incorporates a ‘V’. In 1796, John\n\nShipp was the first veterinary surgeon commissioned into the Army. He joined the 11th Light Dragoons on 25 June 1796, a\n\ndate now recognised as the Foundation Day of the RAVC – John Shipp Day. The Army Veterinary Corps was formed in\n\n1903 to unite veterinary officers under one badge. At the outbreak of WW1 there were 180 officers and 208 other ranks in\n\nthe Army Veterinary Corps. By 1918 this had increased to 1700 officers and 28,000 other ranks. King George V accorded\n\nthe Corps its Royal Warrant in 1919. Primarily concerned with horses, the Army Veterinary and Remount Service\n\namalgamated in 1942 and became responsible for managing the Army’s dog resources in 1946. During WW2 the use of dogs\n\nfor military purposes grew. Dogs are an invaluable aid to ground troops and since WW2 have been used in most operational\n\ntheatres",

She called on the Matron and asked if she had a few lonely patients\n\n\n\nwho would like to come out for tea. The Matron looked surprised and replied that there were in fact 600 injured patients lying\n\n\n\nin the hospital, with many more across the country. Marta was horrified by what she saw.\n\n\n\nAn avid charity worker during the Great War, Marta soon set about contacting her friends to organise tea parties, concerts and\n\n\n\noutings for those able to attend. During one of these early invitations one injured soldier said: “We don’t want no charity Miss,\n\n\n\nwe are forgotten by everybody and we’d better stop so.” But, undeterred, in August 1920, Marta formed the “NOT\n\n\n\nFORGOTTEN” Association for the ‘comfort, cheer and entertainment’ of the war wounded and within a year some 10,000 men\n\n\n\nhad been entertained.\n\n\n\nThe memorial is made of solid green polished granite with a sculptured elephant’s head on top. The elephant and sword form\n\n\n\nthe basis of the emblem of the association.\n\n\n\nThe plaque on the ground outlines the part of Marta Cunningham in setting up the Association.\n\n\n\nThe Not Forgotten Association is a charity that continues to provide events for wounded serving personnel and disabled\n\n\n\nveterans, which improve physical and mental health, address isolation and loneliness, and provide a sense of community and\n\n\n\nbalance.\n\n\n\nThe Victoria Cross\n\n\n\nThe Victoria Cross is awarded for:-\n\n\n\n... most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in\n\nthe presence of the enemy.\n\n\n\nThe VC is the first level award for all ranks of the British armed forces.\n\n\n\nThe Victoria Cross was founded by Royal Warrant dated 29th January 1856. Queen Victoria presented the first 62 awards in\n\nHyde Park on 26th June 1857: 12 Navy, 2 Royal Marines and 48 Army.\n\n\n\nThe warrant has been amended several times. E.g.:\n\n\n\nIn 1902 King Edward VII approved the principle of awarding the VC posthumously.\n\nOn 21st October 1911 King George V admitted native officers and other ranks of the Indian Army to eligibility for\n\n\n\nthe VC.\n\nThe warrant of 22nd May 1922 extended the scope of the award to include members of the RAF, and ‘Air Forces of\n\n\n\nour Dominions, Colonies, Dependencies or Protectorates’; and ‘Matrons, sisters, nurses and staff of the Nursing\n\nServices and other services pertaining to Hospitals and Nursing and civilians of either sex serving regularly or\n\nTemporarily under the orders, direction or supervision’ of specified Naval Military or Air Forces.\n\n\n\nThe medal, made from the bronze cascabels of cannon captured at Sebastopol, has always been manufactured by Messrs\n\nHancocks of London.\n\n\n\nThe ribbon, 1½ inches wide, has been crimson since the Royal Warrant of 22nd May 1920 (originally it was crimson for the\n\narmy and dark blue for the navy) and the inscription on the medal reads ‘FOR VALOUR’. When the ribbon is worn alone a\n\nminiature of the V.C. is placed at the centre of the ribbon.\n\n\n\nThe bar to the V.C. has been awarded on only three occasions: Captain Arthur Martin-Leake R.A.M.C. (Vlakfontein, South\n\nAfrica 1902 and Zonnebeke 1914), Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse R.A.M.C. (Guillemont 1916 and Wieltje1917) and\n\nCaptain Charles Hazlitt Upham NZ Army (Crete 1941 and Western Desert 1942).\n\n\n\nThe Victoria Cross has been awarded on1358 occasions; to 1355 individuals, the three bars mentioned above and one to the\n\nUnknown Soldier buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Washington, DC. In addition to British service personnel it has\n\nbeen awarded to 5 civilians and to 14 non British Empire/Commonwealth citizens.\n\n\n\nIn recent years Canada, Australia and New Zealand have awarded their own version of the Victoria Cross through their own\n\nhonours systems. One New Zealand VC and 4 Australian VCs have been awarded.\n\n\n\nFive of the largest public collections of Victoria Cross’ are in the Australian War Memorial which has 80 (including 10 on\n\nloan), The Imperial War Museum which has 45 (including 28 on loan), the National Army Museum which has 40 (including\n\n1 one loan), The Canadian War Museum (which has 39) and the Museum of Military Medicine which has 23.

Membership is limited to men who served in the nuclear test\n\nareas, their widows and their descendants.\n\n\n\nThe Nuclear Test Program\n\n\n\nBetween 1952 and 1958 21 atmospheric tests took place at the locations listed on the memorial.

Their\n\ncommitment and service has preserved peace for the past 70 years, and it is only right their contribution to our safety, freedom and\n\nway of life is appropriately recognised with this honour.\n\n\n\nThis medal is an enduring symbol of our country’s gratitude to each and every person who played a part in this effort and their loved\n\nones who supported them.”\n\n\n\nHM Government website states that:\n\n\n\nThe Nuclear Test Medal will be a commemorative medal that can be worn by recipients.\n\n\n\nThe medal also recognises the contribution made by veterans and civilians from across Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Kiribati. All\n\nservice personnel and civilians under UK command, including close partners from the Commonwealth and Pacific region, who\n\nparticipated in, or were present at, the British or American nuclear tests at the Montebello Islands, Christmas Island, Malden Island\n\nand Maralinga & Emu Field, South Australia between 1952 and 1967 will be eligible for the medal. This also includes scientists and\n\nlocal employees.\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that around 22,000 veterans will be eligible for the medal.",

Minesweeping activities were vital to the\n\ntask of keeping open the shipping lanes around the United Kingdom and further afield. The RNPS was involved in the Norway Campaign\n\nwhere Captain (then Lieutenant) Richard Stannard was awarded the Victoria Cross while in command of HMT Arab being attacked\n\nfrom the air at Namsos.\n\n\n\nThousands of troops were ferried back to the United Kingdom from Dunkirk by ships of the RNPS. As the war developed, the RNPS\n\ncould be found in many naval theatres – from the eastern seaboard of the USA, where refitted trawlers were lost to the U-boats they\n\nwere searching for, to the Mediterranean, where HMT Moonstone captured the Italian submarine ‘Galileo Galilei’. In 1944, 235\n\nminesweepers swept the Channel ahead of the invasion fleet.\n\n\n\nThe bravery of ‘Harry Tate’s Navy’ or ‘Churchill’s pirates’, as they had come to be known, is told by their losses – over 5,000 men\n\nperished, 2,385 with no known grave but the sea, and 475 ships never returned to port.",

On 17 November aircraft from HMS Formidable attacked U-Boat U-331 (the U-Boat that\n\nsank HMS Barham) and sank her.\n\n\n\nOn 17 July 1944, Swordfish aircraft from HMS Formidable were involved in an attack on the Tirpitz in Norway and took part in further\n\nattacks on Tirpitz in August.\n\n\n\nDuring 1945 she saw service against Japanese forces with British Pacific Fleet and survived several kamikaze attacks while supporting\n\nthe landings on Okinawa. On 4 May a Japanese kamikaze plane crashed into the flight deck, making a massive dent about 10 feet long,\n\ntwo feet wide and two feet deep in the armoured flight deck. A large steel splinter ruptured a steam line, and came to rest in a fuel\n\ntank, starting a major fire in the aircraft park. Eight crew members were killed and forty-seven were wounded: the 3\" armoured steel\n\nflight deck of HMS Formidable prevented further damage by Kamikaze attacks. By 5pm the fires were brought under control, the crater\n\nin the deck was repaired and Corsairs were again able to land on Formidable. A further Kamikaze hit HMS Formidable's flight deck on\n\n9 May, but the level of damage was nowhere near as serious.\n\n\n\nThe accumulation of damage through the war took its toll on the ship. The bomb damage received in the Mediterranean had left her\n\nwith damage that was beyond economical repair. She was placed in reserve in 1947 and was sold for scrap in 1953.\n\n\n\nThe blue plaque on the face of the stone memorial contains details of HMS Formidable’s Battle Honours and a reference to Lieutenant\n\nRobert Hampton Gray VC, DSC, RCNVR of 1841 Squadron - a Canadian naval officer, pilot, and posthumous recipient of the last Victoria\n\nCross (VC) of the Second World War. Robert Hampton Gray is thought to be one of the last Canadians to die during the Second World\n\nWar.\n\n\n\nLocated behind the main memorial to HMS Formidable is an oak tree which was planted by the HMS Formidable Association on 22\n\nSeptember 2001 and commemorates in tribute “all who served in and flew from this great ship”.",

The\n\nphotographs etched on the memorial depict various aspects of their work including air patrols as shown by the aircraft flying past\n\nMount Kenya.\n\n\n\nOn 10th August 2022 a Hexahedral Stone plinth (also of black Indian marble)was placed in front of the memorial: on it is the Kenya\n\nPolice insignia (bronze) which was originally installed above the force headquarters in Nairobi. It was returned tothe UK after Kenya\n\ngained independence.\n\n\n\nA History\n\n\n\nThe Kenya Police has its roots in the early British East African Police. This remarkably small force grew slowly with the protectorate,\n\nwith only the first organised policemen being established in Mombasa in 1896. The force consisted of just a few British and imperial\n\nofficers, European Police Constables, Indian sepoys and African askaris. Many of these came from military backgrounds and indeed a\n\nnumber of Regular Army drill instructors were also seconded from Britain to assist with the training of new recruits.\n\n\n\nIn 1920, with the establishment of Kenya Colony, the Kenya Police was then formed. The force remained very small and had limited\n\nresources, then required to deal primarily with the settler increase. All policemen had to be a jack of all trades in the fledgling colony\n\nand their duties were well beyond what would be seen as normal policing today. A significant reduction in police resources during the\n\nGreat Depression years and the resulting austerity, stretched the force even further. Secret societies often sprang up which needed to\n\nbe dealt with by the law. It was therefore frequently deployed on various internal operations, often in support of the military. During\n\nboth of the world wars, the Kenya Police took part in routine military and counter insurgency operations, mostly within the borders of\n\nthe colony. Throughout this period, there was constant fighting in the North Frontier Province, with criminal armed incursions across\n\nthe borders by the Shifta banditry amongst others. The force remained very much paramilitary in nature, due of course to the policing\n\nrequirements of the time.\n\n\n\nThe post war period then saw a significant increase in crime, leading up to the Mau Mau Emergency declared in 1952. This led to a\n\nrapid expansion, with more police deploying into the native reserves in that year, where policing had previously been left up to the\n\nadministration in the main. The Kenya Police Reserve also played a significant part in the campaign and by December 1953, there were\n\nover 8,000 serving reservist officers. These were both full time and part time policemen from all of the races in Kenya. By that time,\n\nthe regular police consisted of over 1,000 Europeans, 185 Asians and around 10,000 Africans. Due to the significant threat at that time,\n\nnearly 300 contract officers were also recruited mainly from the United Kingdom. The Kenya Police then consisted of many vital\n\ncapabilities. These included the Police Airwing, the General Service Unit, Mounted Squadron, Dog Section, Tracker Combat Teams,\n\nalong with the routine traffic department, police stations and posts across the whole of the colony. Vital support was provided by the\n\nSignals, Prosecutions and Transport Branches. The Railway Police and a small maritime force in Mombasa, also had to police the lines\n\nof communication. The period saw in particular, the establishment of a very much expanded Special Branch and CID. The police worked\n\nclosely with the military in most operations throughout what was a very difficult time for all in Kenya. Of note, the use of Pseudo gangs\n\ninvolved both policemen and soldiers, disguised as terrorists, operating deep in the forests. This was certainly a significant tactical\n\nsuccess which helped locate and defeat the remaining Mau Mau gangs.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency formally ended in 1960, but the Mau Mau threat had effectively been dealt with by 1956. However, there remained\n\nvarious internal problems in Kenya up until Independence in 1963, which had to be dealt with by the police. The Shifta campaign on\n\nthe Somali border in particular, became politicised and very much a significant issue for both the police and the military, well into the\n\n1960s. This exacerbated the already problematic Northern Frontier and its often near lawless state. Many European officers\n\nnevertheless, stayed on during the period providing some stability to the force during this difficult time - which of course was also one\n\nof careful transition to the new Kenya Police.",

The Memorial is a stunning piece of architecture\n\ndesigned by Liam O’Connor, which draws its inspiration from the ancient landscapes of prehistoric Britain and the classical forms\n\nof ancient Rome. It consists of a six-metre-high earth mound, 100 metres wide at the base reducing to 50 metres wide at the\n\ntop, which is based on early British barrows or tumuli. The spiral walkway that navigates the grassy slopes, planted with clipped\n\nholm oaks 'Quercus ilex', provides accessibility to people of all ages and levels of mobility. At the top of the mound stands a 43\n\nmetre diameter stone structure, comprising two curved walls and two straight walls which are constructed of 200,000 bricks\n\nfaced with over 1,000 tonnes of Portland stone panels. In recognition of the importance of Armistice Day, a gap has been left in\n\nthe two southern walls, which allows a shaft of sunlight to penetrate to the heart of the Memorial, onto the central bronze\n\nwreath.\n\nThe Memorial is particularly important for the many families and friends who have no grave to visit, or who remember those in\n\ngraves in far-off places. The Memorial plays a valuable role in helping all who grieve for an Armed Forces service person to come\n\nto terms with their loss, by providing a focus for their grief as they pass through different stages of their lives. The names are\n\narranged firstly by year and then in service order: Royal Navy, Army and then the Royal Air Force. Within service order the names\n\nare arranged chronologically, in the order of the event which caused the death. This ensures that those who died together are\n\nrecorded and remembered together. The name and initials are shown without ranks but, where appropriate, honours are also\n\nincluded.

However, the\n\nDivision subsequently got caught in German enfilade (flanking) fire from the side and from behind and with the possibility of\n\nbeing cut off with limited supplies they withdrew and were relieved the following day having suffered heavy causalities.\n\n\n\nThe bravery and exploits of the Division are legendary - seeing action in many of the subsequent campaigns of the Western\n\nFront until the Armistice in November 1918. The Division ceased all military action at the end of June 1919 when the last\n\nsoldiers were de-mobbed.\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that The Great War cost 36th (Ulster) Division 32,186 men killed, wounded or missing.\n\n\n\nThe memorial comprises a large, rustic, black granite stone on a base plinth with a black polished façade inscribed with gold\n\nlettering. The stone’s rugged profile, suggesting the toughness of the men who fought in the 36th (Ulster) Division, is\n\nemphasised by the lines of the polished face.\n\n\n\nThe heraldic Red Hand of Ulster (depicted: sinister / left), which is the insignia badge of the 36th Division, is featured at the\n\ntop of the memorial above the following inscription:\n\n\n\nThis memorial is dedicated to the Officers and Men of the 36th (Ulster) Division who fought in the 1st World War and the\n\nNursing and Medical corps who served beside them.\n\n\n\nAt the centre of the memorial is a reproduction of the famous James Prinsep Beadle painting ‘The Attack of the Ulster Division’\n\ndepicting a scene on the fist day of the Battle of the Somme (1 July 1916), the original of which hangs in the City Hall, Belfast.\n\nThe Division’s Western Front campaigns are listed either side of this.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, soil from each of Ulster’s nine Counties has been placed within the memorial along with soil from the following\n\nbattlefield sites: Somme, Messines, Passchendaele, Wytchaete and Polcapelle.\n\n\n\nIn total, nine members of the 36th (Ulster) Division were awarded the Victoria Cross, four of which were awarded for actions\n\nduring the Battle of the Somme.\n\n\n\nBelow the central painting is a verse from the poem Remember Them by D. Ross Campbell:\n\n\n\nThey heard the call, they answered yes,\n\n\n\nThey proudly wore the battle dress,\n\n\n\nFor us who live they gave their all\n\n\n\nThat our great flag would never fall.\n\n\n\nThe base of the memorial displays the inscription: At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them,\n\nwhilst the reverse notes the memorial was funded by the 36th (Ulster) Division Memorial Association.\n\n\n\nFootnote:\n\n\n\nThe famous Ulster Tower memorial (based on Helen's Tower in Clandboye near Belfast), which dominates the skyline around\n\nthe village of Thiepval in Northern France, occupies the site of what was the German Front Line and is opposite Thiepval Wood\n\nwhere the 36th (Ulster) Division made its historic charge on the first day of the Battle of the Somme.",

    "description": "'Moving Forward, Looking Back'\n\n\n\nThis memorial was commissioned to coincide with the 225th anniversary of the raising of the Cheshire Yeomanry Regiment.\n\nWith the constant uncertainties of future British Army structures and the unknown future threats of town planning, what\n\nbetter place to secure our memorial, for future generations of Cheshire Yeomen, than at the National Memorial Arboretum.\n\nWe now have a permanent and fitting place to lay our wreaths and pay our respects to all our comrades. We have a focal point\n\nto be able to contemplate those that have gone before us.\n\n\n\nThe Cheshire Yeomanry was raised as a light cavalry regiment in 1797 under the threat of a Napoleonic invasion. The regiment\n\nhas built a proud history during that period. Our role remains today as Light Cavalry and throughout its early history up to and\n\nduring World War 2 the regiment served with its constant companion, the horse. Since then, we have had another type of\n\ncompanion, who has been our protection, our weapon, our shelter and our means of transport, the mechanised vehicle. Our\n\nmemorial represents the strength and power of a horse, but at the same time represents through its design, examples of many\n\nof those other vehicles.\n\n\n\nDesigner and Sculptor - Joanne Risley (Sculptor)\n\n\n\n“I was very honoured to have been chosen to create the memorial sculpture for the Cheshire Yeomanry to celebrate 225 years\n\nsince its inception. In response to the brief, I have designed a life-sized rearing war horse created using the mechanisms,\n\nstructure and detail found on the Fox, Ferret and Jackal armoured vehicles.\n\n\n\nObjects of war mix with more familiar domestic objects such as a spade and the beloved ‘BV’ boiling vessel that provides the\n\ncrew with hot water for tea and cooking. The plinth carries a turret wheel which frames the cast bronze regimental crest. I\n\nhave tried to encapsulate the strength and dynamism of the animal with the armoured feel of the regiment’s vehicles.\n\n\n\nThe arboretum already features a highly naturalistic life-size horse so I wanted to create a unique and modern monument that\n\nwould strike a different note. The regiment kindly provided historic context, photographic material and access to Fox Barracks\n\nwhere I was able to study one of the Jackal vehicles up close. At the Cheshire Military Museum the Fox and Ferret armoured\n\nvehicles provided further inspiration.\n\n\n\nThe body of the horse is tank-like and incorporates toeholds, wheel arches, rear lights and smoke canisters. The legs and thighs\n\nare formed from wheels and tyre treads with the helmet-like head supported by gun parts and a spine and ribs derived from\n\nthe Jackal anti-roll system.\n\n\n\nThe whole sculpture stands 3m tall. Created from weathering steel, which contains copper and smaller bronze elements, the\n\noverall appearance will take on a rusted and aged appearance whilst the material’s unique properties provide a protective\n\nsurface that will endure indefinitely.\n\n\n\nAs well as being of symbolic and emotional importance to the regiment, the horse embodies courage, freedom, power,\n\nendurance, personal drive, passion and heroism. The animal appears to be moving forward but looking back in order to\n\nrepresent soldiers of the regiment past and present.\n\n\n\nJoanne Risley studied Fine Art at Mid-Cheshire College, Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and then at The University of\n\nUlster.\n\n\n\nShe was elected a member of Manchester Academy of Fine Art in 2017. www.joannerisley.co.uk\n\n\n\nMaterials Used - Rusted Corten steel, copper, and smaller bronze elements.\n\n\n\nAge of Memorial - The build was completed during 2021 and installed at the NMA in June 2022 and a dedication ceremony\n\nwas held 12th June 2022.\n\n\n\nSymbolism - The Memorial has been created to allow visitors to remember those lost and to contemplate, surrounded by the\n\nmemorials of all Yeomanry Regiments and positioned so that there is a full view from all angles of Yeomanry Avenue.",

Prince Richard, Duke of\n\nGloucester, who is the Grand Prior of the Order of St John, officially opened the memorial in 2009; however, it took some\n\nfourteen years to completion and was not finally completed until 2022.\n\n\n\nThe design of the memorial takes the form of the St John (Amalfi) Cross. The entrance is through one of the arms of the cross\n\nwhich is flanked by two granite panels depicting the badge of St John and the Priory of England and the Islands. At the centre\n\nof the cross is a black granite stone with the inscription: “In honour of all those who have faithfully served the Venerable Order\n\nof the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem and its foundations.”\n\n\n\nThe other various priory emblems are fixed to the arms of the memorial in order of precedence (It should be noted that\n\nbecause the cross was designed to give a particular perspective when viewed from the front, the tops of the walls which form\n\nthe arms of the cross are slanted and therefore are not necessarily horizontal. In order to ensure that all the plaques are in\n\nline with each other when the monument is viewed as a whole, individual plaques will not always be parallel to the tops of the\n\nrespective wall to which they are attached.)\n\n\n\nThe Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem shares its origins with the religious Knights Hospitaller, who served\n\nin a hospice in Jerusalem which looked after pilgrims in the twelfth century. The English branch was dissolved by King Henry\n\nVIII in 1540 and briefly reinstated by Queen Mary in 1557. An early 19th century move to revive the Order in England eventually\n\nresulted in the creation of a British Royal Order of Chivalry. Her Majesty Queen Victoria granted the Order of St John a Royal\n\nCharter and became its Sovereign Head in 1888. The Order, as an Order of Chivalry, is unique in its corporate work for the\n\nbenefit of society. It has two key foundations: the St John of Jerusalem Eye Hospital and St John Ambulance.\n\n\n\nThe Order conducts its affairs around the world through the St John Eye Hospital Group, 11 Priories, 5 Commanderies and 32\n\nAssociations. The Priory of England and the Islands manages the day-to-day affairs of Order business in England, Northern\n\nIreland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. The Priory’s main role is delivered by its subsidiary charity StJohn Ambulance\n\nwhich delivers first aid and first aid training in the community. It also carries out Ambulance work in support of the NHS, and\n\nhas a thriving Youth movement.\n\n\n\nThe Order is also involved in welfare services alongside the British Red Cross Society of the International Red Cross through a\n\nresidential home for ex servicemen and women, ex-nurses and ex-members of St John and the Red Cross. The welfare of\n\npatients in Service Hospitals is looked after by the Order of St John and British Red Cross Defence Medical Welfare Service.\n\nFurthermore, in association with the British Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, through the Orders of St John\n\nCare Trust the Priory promotes the Trust’s work with residential care homes and alms houses.

Bronze is a metal alloy, or mixture\n\nof tin and copper, and was used extensively to make a wide range of tools and weapons.\n\n\n\nThe monument was first identified from an aerial photograph taken in 1965, which revealed the visible cropmarks of a prehistoric\n\nmultiple ring ditch. It was later Scheduled as a site of historic significance in 1969. Although there is little in the way of discernible\n\nremains above ground the site is now a set-aside wildflower meadow which attracts much important wildlife.\n\n\n\nDuring excavations in 1996, a prehistoric pottery vessel thought to be a late example of Beaker Ware, was discovered by archaeologists\n\nabout 0.5m below the surface. Very few examples have been found in the Trent Valley and so this is an important find. The vessel is\n\ncurrently on display in the Landscapes of Life exhibition in the Remembrance Centre.\n\n\n\nIn the Bronze Age, many important people were buried under mounds like this one. Excavations show that it was probably part of a\n\nmuch bigger commemorative landscape that included other burial monuments. Between 1500 and 500 BC, this prehistoric landscape\n\nseems to have changed. No new monuments were built, and the meaning of the old ones probably faded as farming and flooding\n\neroded their remains. Thousands of years later, archaeologists working during quarrying are revealing their stories.\n\n\n\nBronze Age burial mounds marked territory and reflected status. Their size and positioning in the landscape sent out a message. This\n\nmound is set above where the River Tame meets the Trent.",

    "description": "A tribute to the unique contribution made by horses throughout history in times of War. Recognising their continuing service to\n\nhumankind in Work, Rehabilitation, Education, Sport and Leisure.\n\n\n\nIn 2013 a group of people with a love of horses came together with a vision to create a memorial acknowledging the horse’s unfaltering\n\nservice to humankind and to celebrate the unique relationship between horses and humans that exists through sport, history, work,\n\nrehabilitation, education and leisure. This beautiful sculpture and its carefully planned setting were unveiled in 2019, made possible\n\nthrough generous donations and the work of local craftspeople who contributed their skills to realising the vision of Free Spirit.\n\n\n\nFree Spirit is a unique project that embodies the inclusiveness that is reflected in the non-judgmental partnership between horse and\n\nhuman. Gartmore Riding School in Hammerwich and many contributors raised funds to create a life-sized bronze statue acknowledging\n\nthe horse’s unfaltering service to humanity, to be displayed at the National Memorial Arboretum, Staffordshire.\n\n\n\nThere are few people left today that remember the essential role the horse played through history and how until a generation ago the\n\nhorse was part of everyday life. The memorial expresses endurance, service and partnership and represents determination and trust,\n\ninspiration for which came from young people. The project brought together individuals from all ages and backgrounds sharing the\n\nimportance of the horse to different generations, ethnicities and religions.\n\n\n\nThe groundwork has been carefully designed to welcome all visitors, regardless of mobility or disability, allowing all members of society\n\nto enjoy the memorial together. The provision of spaces between the seats creates multiple points of access for wheelchair users; a\n\nlower plinth height and plaques incorporating Braille and Makaton allow the visually impaired to enjoy the memorial through a tactile\n\nexperience.\n\n\n\nFree Spirit brought the essential contribution that the horse has made to humanity to new audiences and generations in a number of\n\nprojects, including art, music and history, and worked across the local community and beyond. The opportunity to meet a pony has\n\nnever been easily accessible to many of the young people visiting by the project, and Free Spirit recognises that the unique relationship\n\nbetween horse and human can increase confidence and self-esteem, and that this connection leaves a legacy that continues to bring\n\njoy to this and future generations.\n\n\n\nThe horse is part of our story, and the people involved in its inception and creation were particularly proud to see so many young\n\npeople engaging with the project. Inspired by the thoughts and feelings of these young people, Birmingham songwriter Dominic Malin\n\nwrote a signature song for Free Spirit. The song embraces the qualities associated with the horse and the music reflects the past,\n\nengages with the present and carries a message into the future.\n\n\n\nIt is an honour to have horses in our lives and Free Spirit represents this for centuries and generations to come.",

The Quarry Garden, designed by award winning garden designer Paul Hervey-Brookes, shows the contribution of the\n\nquarrying industry in creating the products we use in everyday life through to the diverse habitats they create for plants and animals.\n\n\n\nThe Quarry Garden has been re-created at the National Memorial Arboretum for everyone to enjoy. It is an expression of nature and\n\nhand-crafted stone, blended with mass produced products manufactured from extracted materials. It is a garden experience that\n\ncelebrates modern architecture, natural planting and sculptural elements.\n\n\n\nComprised of a paved avenue, adjacent to Gifford Avenue, which links the Remembrance Centre and the Far East Zone, the garden\n\nfeatures a series of six large, sculpted panels of corten steel (designed by Ann-Margreth Bohl) from the original installation at\n\nChatsworth. Entitled Passing Light the panels are reflective of the quarry face. Each one contains apertures through which light passes\n\nto reveal lengthening shadows and views across the landscape.\n\n\n\nThree rectangular columns stand at the garden’s entrance - each inscribed with the Institute of Quarrying's Latin motto: Terram autem\n\nfiliis hominum meaning the fruits of the earth for the children of men – (a sentiment loosely associated with Psalm 115 v16) which\n\nprovides the inspiration behind the garden.\n\n\n\nThe Quarry Garden is completed with landscaped areas of planting and seating accompanied by a panel displaying the Institute of\n\nQuarrying's Coat of Arms together with a stone sculpture.",

The request found Captain Percy Scott RN in Simons Bay. His crew had,\n\nin 24 hours, prepared two 4.7-inch guns and four 12-pounders for land warfare. Under the command of Captain Hedworth Lambton\n\nRN, the Naval Brigade set out over land for Ladysmith. Crews from HMS Powerful and HMS terrible were formed for this task.\n\n\n\nAfter oxen failed to haul the guns across the rough terrain, only one option was left. The Naval Brigade (Bluejackets) had to haul the\n\nguns by muscle power themselves and still managed to arrive within 48 hours. Soon after their arrival at Ladysmith the siege of 119\n\ndays began. More men from the ships set out with more guns of both 4.7” and 12-pounders with a six in monster called “ROMA”.\n\n\n\nThe Determination, Teamwork and Dedication of the Bluejackets captured the public’s hearts back home and, on the ships, return the\n\nNaval Brigades were to be paraded. This was so popular that the following year a tournament was staged at the 1900 Military\n\nTournament at the Royal Agricultural Hall in Islington, London. The Field Gun Competition was born.\n\n\n\nLater the Royal Tournament moved to Olympia and then to Earl’s Court. Earl’s Court became the home to the Command Field Gun\n\nCompetition with crews from the ports of Chatham (CHATS), Devonport (GUZZ), Portsmouth (POMPEY) and Fleet Air Arm (Air), who\n\njoined much later in 1947.

    "description": "The Concept\n\n\n\nThe Green Howards (Alexandra, Princess of Wales’s Own Yorkshire Regiment) was a British Army Infantry Regiment raised in 1688 by\n\nColonel Francis Luttrell at Dunster Castle. It was based in Richmond, North Yorkshire and amalgamated for the first and only time in\n\n2006 to form part of The Yorkshire Regiment.\n\n\n\nThe Green Howards has a vibrant Association with branches spread over North Yorkshire and Teesside and others as far away as\n\nLondon and Kent.\n\n\n\nAlthough The Green Howards is well served with memorials honouring its fallen up to 1945, particularly at its home in Richmond and\n\nat Crépon in Normandy, there was nothing in stone, other than The Armed Forces Memorial, where all those who died whilst serving\n\non duty or were killed in action after 1945 are honoured.\n\n\n\nAn application was lodged with the NMA on 8th January 2019 to place an appropriate and proportionate stone dedicated to those\n\nGreen Howards named on the Armed Forces Memorial. It was further deemed appropriate to commemorate all those who have served\n\nwith the Regiment from the time of its raising.\n\n\n\nThe Design Team\n\n\n\nMajor Michael Pickard, a retired Green Howard, was invited to design the stone in June 2018. He was assisted by Colonel Clive Mantell\n\nand Major Tony Warriner, the Chairman and Secretary of the Green Howards Association. It was designed, quarried, carved and\n\nerected in time for a dedication service on the 165th anniversary of the Battle of the Alma on the 19th September 2019.\n\n\n\nThe Design\n\n\n\nThe stone is a waisted, square section, silver/grey granite column, approx. 6 feet 4 inches high, in three parts set on a stone paved\n\nbase.The top part is a solid hand-carved Norwegian King’s Crown with polished extremities and honed on the inner surfaces.\n\n\n\nThe middle part is a plain polished truncated pyramidal form resting on four lower tapered faces.\n\n\n\nOn one face of the stone the lineage displayed creates a permanent and lasting record of the 318 years of its history above a dedication\n\nto all those who have served with the Regiment.\n\n\n\nOn the opposite face is a record of countries where the Regiment has served since 1945 above a dedication to the proud memory of\n\nthose Green Howards killed in action or on duty and honoured on the Armed Forces Memorial.\n\n\n\nEverything on the stone is significant and interlinked:\n\n\n\nThe two badges (one from the first half of the 20th c and the other from the second half) show the cipher of HRH Alexandra, Princess\n\nof Wales, interlaced with the Dannebrog, surmounted by a princess’s coronet and the date 1875 when the Regiment was designated\n\n‘The Princess of Wales’s Own’ (Thus starting the close connection with the Royal Houses of the Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway).\n\n\n\nThe crown at the top recognises the Kings of Norway who were Colonels-in-Chief from 1914 to 2006.\n\n\n\nThe Battle of the Alma, the principal battle honour, celebrated every year on, or near, the dedication day is included to emphasise\n\nthe importance of this anniversary to the Regiment: 19th September 2019.\n\n\n\nThe 19th Regiment of Foot (XIX) features strongly because The Green Howards is one of just a handful of Line Regiments to retain its\n\noriginal designated number.\n\n\n\nMaterial and Construction\n\n\n\nThe silver/grey granite was quarried and cut to shape in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India and then carved and installed by Strongs Memorials\n\nLimited, 39 Park Road, Bloxwich, Walsall, West Midlands WS3 3SS\n\n\n\nProject leader: Andrew Hodgson. Inscription carving: Andrew Walsh. CAD: Mark Abesamis and Robin Mills.\n\n\n\nPosition\n\n\n\nThe stone is positioned 100 metres to the West of the Armed Forces Memorial and close to both the memorials of The Yorkshire\n\nRegiment and the Prince of Wales’s Own Yorkshire Regiment.",

The Royal Dragoon Guards was formed in 1992, as a result of the\n\namalgamation of the 4/7th Royal Dragoon Guards and the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards.\n\n\n\nThe two antecedent regiments were themselves the result of amalgamations in 1922. The 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards formed from\n\namalgamation of the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards and the 7th (Princess Royal’s) Dragoon Guards, and the 5th Royal Inniskill ing\n\nDragoon Guards formed from amalgamation of the 5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales’) Dragoon Guards and the 6th (Inniskilling)\n\nDragoons.\n\n\n\nAll four of the original antecedent regiments were raised between 1685 and 1689, during the protracted contest for the English throne\n\nbetween James II and William of Orange.\n\n\n\nThis memorial is dedicated to all those who fought, served and died while serving in The Royal Dragoon Guards and its antecedent\n\nregiments, from 1685 to the present day. Accordingly, the memorial carries the cap badges of the regiments, together with the motto\n\nof The Royal Dragoon Guards: Quis Separabit (who shall separate us), which is taken from the eighth chapter of St Paul’s Letter to the\n\nRomans.\n\n\n\nAge of Memorial\n\n\n\nThe current memorial replaces an earlier memorial installed in 2008. The trustees of the Regimental Charity, informed by both the\n\nserving and veteran cohorts of the Regiment, agreed the original memorial failed to capture the spirit and tradition of the Regiment\n\nand those who had served it. The current memorial was dedicated on Saturday 11 March 2023.\n\n\n\nSymbolism\n\n\n\nThe Memorial is cut in the shape of a castle, to represent the Watergate that forms part of the ramparts of Enniskillen Castle, where\n\nthe 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons were raised in 1689.\n\n\n\nA device representing the Watergate was worn on the uniforms of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons and later, embroidered onto their\n\nRegimental Guidon in 1751, when the first regulations standardising regimental dress were introduced. The Watergate continued to\n\nbe worn on the uniform of the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards and to be carried on its Regimental Standard. Today, the\n\nWatergate is carried on the Regimental Standard of The Royal Dragoon Guards and forms the centrepiece of the Regimental cap badge,\n\nmounted in the centre of the Star of St Patrick, the cap badge of the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards and later the 4/7th Royal Dragoon\n\nGuards.\n\n\n\nGreen was the regimental colour worn on the facings, (collar and cuffs) of the 5th Dragoon Guards and continued in the uniform of\n\nthe 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards. Today, that tradition continues in the colour of the Regiment’s beret, and the trousers worn\n\nwith barrack, service and ceremonial dress.\n\n\n\nThe engravings on the face of the memorial represent the cap badges of the antecedent regiments.\n\n\n\nThe 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards and 4/7th Royal Dragoon Guards using the Star of St Patrick: the former with a shamrock\n\nsurmounting the cross of St Patrick and the Regimental Motto, Quis Separabit, in the surrounding garter; the latter has the Princess\n\nRoyal’s coronet at its centre, surmounting the cross of St George.\n\n\n\nThe 5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales’) Dragoon Guards has the white horse of Hannover at its centre, surrounded by the letter\n\nV representing the Roman number 5 and the letters DG to represent Dragoon Guards. Around the garter is the Regimental motto,\n\nVestigia Nulla Retrorsum (Never a Rearward Step).\n\n\n\nThis also served as the motto of the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards, whose cap badge was a monogram of the 5th\n\nDragoon Guards, surmounted by the reigning monarch’s crown.\n\n\n\nThe cap badge of the 7th (Princess Royal’s) Dragoon Guards depicts a lion rampant surmounting the Princess Royal’s coronet.\n\nThe lion rampant was the family crest of Lord Ligonier, who commanded the Regiment in 1720. The Regiment was renamed the 7th\n\nDragoon Guards in 1788, the name carried in the scroll below the Princess Royal’s coronet.\n\n\n\nLastly, the Watergate of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, flying the flag of St George mounted on a scroll carrying the name\n\nInniskilling (the Island of Kathleen), which is the traditional Irish spelling for the town of Enniskillen.\n\n\n\nBelow the cap badges, in silver, is the Regimental Motto (Quis Separabit). This was the original motto of the Order of St Patrick, created\n\nby King George III in 1783. This chivalrous order lasted until the partition of Ireland in 1922, although King Charles III remains the\n\nSovereign of the Order to this day.

No.2 Company continued flying\n\ntraining including participation in the Army’s Autumn (1911) manoeuvres.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Flying Corps\n\n\n\nThe Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was formed on 13 May 1912 by absorbing the Air Battalion’s No.1 and No.2 Companies, with No.2\n\nCompany being renamed No.3 Squadron (Military Wing) RFC. On the outbreak of World War 1 the Squadron deployed to France as\n\npart of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in August 1914 on reconnaissance, photography and artillery spotting duties. In October\n\n1917 Sopwith Camels were received, and the Squadron became a fighter / scout unit. After the Armistice, the Squadron was reduced to\n\ncadre strength until re-established at Ambala (India) from January 1920 to September 1921.\n\n\n\nThe Biplane Era\n\n\n\nAfter returning to UK the Squadron spent the 1920s on many short periods at various locations before arriving at Upavon in 1924 with\n\nSopwith Snipes. During their ten-year stay, the Squadron flew Woodcocks, Gamecocks and Bulldogs. The Bulldog was deployed to\n\nSudan during the Abyssinian crisis in 1935. Upon its return from Sudan, No. 3 Squadron introduced the Gladiator into the RAF which\n\nbecame the last biplane operated by the Squadron and as the Second World War started converted to the Hurricane at Biggin Hill.\n\n\n\nWorld War 2\n\n\n\nA brief period with the BEF in France was followed by relocation to Scotland on night-patrol duties. During 1943, the Squadron replaced\n\nthe Hurricanes with Typhoons and switched to the anti-shipping and intruder roles. After re-equipping with Tempests in 1944, the\n\nSquadron destroyed 288 V1 flying bombs, and following D-Day in 1944 moved on to the Continent as part of the advance towards\n\nGermany.\n\n\n\nThe Jet Era\n\n\n\nThe Squadron remained in Germany, converting successively to the Vampire in 1948, the Sabre in 1953 and the Hunter in 1956. After\n\ndisbanding (1957 –1959) a brief time with Javelin fighters was followed by an extended period of Canberra B(I)8 operations, before the\n\nSquadron converted to the Harrier early in 1972 at Wildenrath. In 1977 the unit moved to Gutersloh near the old East German border,\n\nbefore relocating to Laarbruch with the Harrier GR7.\n\n\n\nFollowing the closure of RAF Laarbruch, the Squadron returned to the UK in 1999, to RAF Cottesmore. Subsequently, No. 3 Squadron,\n\nalong with its sister RAF Harrier and Royal Navy Sea Harrier units, combined to form Joint Force Harrier and undertook several\n\ndeployments including on-board HMS Illustrious during operations in Sierra Leone. The Harrier aircraft of No 3 Squadron also saw\n\naction in Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina and both of the Iraq conflicts.\n\n\n\nFarewell to the Harrier\n\n\n\nOn the 31 March 2006, the Squadron relinquished its Harrier role and moved to RAF Coningsby becoming the third RAF, and first\n\nfront-line Squadron to be equipped with the Eurofighter Typhoon. The Squadron’s Typhoons continue to contribute to the RAF’s ongoing commitments in Iraq & Syria plus participating in the Falkland Islands detachments and QRA (Quick Reaction Alert) to the\n\npresent day.\n\n\n\nThe date of dedication is May 12th 2023, a date which closely commemorates the 111th Anniversary of the Squadron’s inclusion in the\n\nRoyal Flying Corps in 1912.\n\n\n\nSymbolism\n\n\n\nThere are two faces to the memorial, the aspect facing the Armed Forces Memorial carries the Squadron’s battle honours, while the\n\nother side records the time line of its origin in 1911 and its status as recorded in official Air Ministry records. Both aspects carry the\n\nSquadron badge with the inscription ‘Tertius Primus Erit’ – The Third Will Be First. The central image is of a cockatrice mounted on a\n\nmonolith, said to represent a fallen stone from Stonehenge. A cockatrice is a mythical beast that is hatched by a serpent from an egg laid\n\nby a rooster, and reputedly able to kill at a glance. The frontal aspect carries two smaller badges, one representing the first location of\n\nLarkhill on Salisbury Palin in 1912. Again, the stones symbolise the Squadron’s location of nearby Stonehenge. The second badge is\n\ncarried on the Typhoon FGR4, which commenced operations in 2006.",

They form a small\n\ngrove, shaped as a triangle. The Oak trees symbolise the pilots o Hearts of Oak.\n\n\n\nThe reason for establishing the memorial\n\n\n\nOn 14th May 2004 the surviving WW2 members of the squadron, then all in their eighties, assembled at the National Memorial\n\nArboretum with family members and friends to commemorate all the officers and men who served in 835 RNAS in World War II. Those\n\npresent particularly related to service spent aboard the aircraft carrier HMS Nairana. They especially met to remember their seven\n\ncolleagues who made the ultimate sacrifice when serving aboard HMS Nairana.\n\n\n\nSquadron History\n\n\n\nThe squadron was commissioned in February 1942 as a convoy protection squadron equipped with 4 Swordfish aircraft. Subsequently\n\nthe squadron served for short periods aboard H.M. Ships Furious, Activity, Battler, Chaser and Argus, all aircraft carriers, and during\n\nthe period May 1942 to November 1943 was moved from place to place no fewer than 16 times.\n\n\n\nIn 1943 the squadron was equipped with 12 Swordfish and 6 Sea Hurricane aircraft and on 31st December that year it embarked on\n\nboard HMS Nairana, which was to be its parent ship until decommissioning at the end of March 1945. During this period the squadron\n\nhelped to protect 19 convoys from which only one merchantman (a straggler) was lost. Those who came to the dedication Service at the\n\nArboretum were mainly associated with those who served and died whilst attached to the aircraft carrier, HMS Nairana.\n\n\n\nInitially, the squadron that served aboard the Nairana was used to protect Gibraltar convoys and on anti U-boat operations in the Atlantic\n\nbut after the fighter flight was re-equipped with 6 Wildcat aircraft in September 1944, she was transferred the next month to escorting\n\nconvoys to Russia and to operations against German shipping in the Norwegian fjords.\n\n\n\nGerman U-boats were only dangerous at periscope level from where they could identify and attack their targets. The primary duty of\n\nSwordfish was therefore to patrol the convoy and to attack with depth-charges or other weapons, any U-boats that became visible at\n\nperiscope level. Although such Swordfish attacks were minimal, their constant patrolling, both night and day and in all weathers, kept\n\nthe U-boats submerged for long periods.\n\n\n\nWhen convoys, of necessity, sailed close to enemy coastlines they risked attack by land-based enemy aircraft. In such situations it was\n\nthe turn of the Sea Hurricanes and the Wildcat aircraft from the Nairana, and any of the other carriers, to defend the convoy.\n\n\n\nThe Nairana, a converted cargo ship, had a flight deck of just 495 feet long and 60 feet wide and a maximum speed of 17 knots. A former\n\nSquadron Commander would eventually write a book about the squadron when serving on the Nairana in Arctic conditions. In one\n\npassage he referred to the airmen’s ability “to land and take off from such a small ‘moving runway’ in 70 mph gales, with ship tossing,\n\ncorkscrewing and rolling sometimes at 100 degrees.” This is beyond belief. The aircrew did this hundreds of times, often on a snowcovered deck and in virtual darkness. At the same time, the ship and those in flight, were constantly at risk of attack from the enemy.\n\n\n\nThe seven aircrew who made the ultimate sacrifice:\n\n\n\nTony Costello, Jack Dalton and George Field took off in their Swordfish from HMS Nairana in bad weather to make a regular patrol of\n\nthe convoy. Sadly, they were never seen or heard of again.\n\n\n\nLou Wilmot and George Ferguson were both killed when their Swordfish crash-landed on the Nairana in bad weather and then fell into\n\nthe sea.\n\n\n\nCharles Richardson, flying a Sea Hurricane from HMS Nairana, was shot down and killed when he engaged a 4 engine German JU290\n\nthat was attacking the convoy.\n\n\n\nDusty Miller, flying a Wildcat from HMS Nariana, seemingly despatched a Junker 88 before being shot down and killed himself whilst\n\nengaging several enemy aircraft that were attacking the convoy.",

As the battle intensified Talaiasi Lablaba, a\n\nFijian was firing the 25-pounder field gun directly at the enemy forces who were only yards away\n\nfrom the gun pit. Walid Khamis of the Omani gun team and Sekonaia Takevesi another Fijian had\n\nbeen seriously wounded.\n\n\n\nTommy Tobin the medic was tending to them when he was shot in the jaw, a wound that was to\n\nlater to prove fatal. Labalaba was shot in the neck whilst trying to retrieve a mortar nearby.\n\n\n\nThe defence of the gun pit was taken over by Mike Kealy and Takavesi until about two hours later a relief\n\nforce of fighter planes and helicopter borne soldiers of 22 SAS arrived to rout the enemy.\n\n\n\nThis battle turned the tide of war to victory.\n\n\n\nThe memorial was dedicated on the 19th July 2009.\n\n\n\nThe memorial plaque was designed by Mike Colton.\n\n\n\nDedicated in 2009.",
